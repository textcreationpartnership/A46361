         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE TRANSLATOR'S ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE learned <hi>Author</hi> hath given the world an account of the
Occaſion, and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of his <hi>Legal Exceptions,</hi> or <hi>Lawful
Prejudices</hi> againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> in the <hi>Preface</hi> to that
<hi>Book,</hi> of which this is an <hi>abridgment.</hi> 'Tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that in
both he principally deſigned the advantage of his Country-men, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom
the greateſt wits have been employd to cover the deformity, and paint over
the foulneſs of <hi>Popery</hi>) and conſequently ſome Citations, and
paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages will ſeem obſcute to an (ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary) <hi>English</hi> Reader.
But the preſent circumſtances of our <hi>Nation,</hi> abundantly juſtify
the <hi>Tranſlating,</hi> and <hi>publishing</hi> a work of this deſign.
For tho the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>writers</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England</hi> have ſufficiently diſcovered the falſehood and 
<pb facs="tcp:94715:3"/>danger of the <hi>Popish Doctrines,</hi> yet the threatning
Infection of our Age calleth for a ſtronger Antidote. 'Tis found by
experience, that the cleareſt Notions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout theſe things are too weak to
preſerve from Apoſtacy in a time of Tryal. Nothing can do this but deep
Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on the Conſcience, which can produce an invincible Antipathy
againſt <hi>Popery.</hi> And I know nothing ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to work this, as
a due Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Characters</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi>
that are to be found in the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> If once a man is ſatisfied
of this, and withal hath a due concern for his own ſalvation, tho he wants
learning to plead againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> yet he will be able chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to
lay down his life in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat againſt it. It hath been on this
<hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> that ſuch numbers of antient and modern
<hi>Witneſſes,</hi> have with admirable conſtancy, ſuffered in the
defence of the Goſpel againſt the Tyranny of <hi>Rome.</hi> 'Tis therefore
much to be lamented, that our <hi>Author</hi> is ſomewhat miſtaken in his
cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable ſentiments concerning the modern <hi>English</hi> divines, whom
in the concluſion of the <hi>Book</hi> he ſuppoſeth all to tread in the
ſteps of their Predeſſors. Whereas 'tis manifeſt, that the Example, and

to for-bear the terms of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> in their
Controverſies with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that of late,
theſe have paſt for rayling Expreſſions, not fit to be uſed by
Genteel Writers. I heartily wish, that ſuch a Complaiſance had not been
attended with very pernitious effects. Sure 'tis no time now to manage, and
compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuch a declared Enemy of Chriſt, and the Souls of men. The
<hi>Church</hi> doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore owe much to the Courage and Zeal of our
<hi>Author,</hi> who hath entred the liſts againſt her, with the Spirit and
Weapons of a true Combatant, and hath ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſcovered the
nakedneſs and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Apocalyptick <hi>Harlot,</hi> that it muſt
be madneſs for any either to fall in love with her, or have any kind thoughts
for her. The Reader will find many paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of this Book to have an air of
plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs and diverſion, (as indeed 'tis a hard matter to forbear
laughter when the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are extravagantly ridiculous) but I earneſtly
requeſt this from him, that he would take heed of jeſting in ſo ſerious
a matter: 'tis by no means enough, to laugh and tell ſtories againſt
<hi>Popery:</hi> 'tis alwayes to be remembred, with what deſign theſe
ridiculous paſſages are related, which is (not <pb facs="tcp:94715:4"/>to make the
Reader merry, but) to convince the Conſcience, that the <hi>Roman Church</hi>
is the <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Apoſtate Society, which hath eſtablicht
herſelf by the moſt abominable Lyes and Fables, as well as by the moſt
bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Cruelty. The Reader is entreared to make this Application of the
whole; otherwiſe the Labour of writing, and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating the Book, will be
loſt: The Lord grant it may not.</p>

            <head type="sub">A short Deſcription of the Papacy.</head>
            <p>TO divert and entertain Monſr. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> I shall once
more act the part of a <hi>Mountebank,</hi> as he is pleas'd to term it: he
shall have the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to ſee a <hi>ſecond Preſervative</hi> of my
writing; and this may afford him a new Subject of raillery to imploy his wit,
as he formerly did in his Reflections upon the <hi>firſt Preſervative,</hi>
which I publisht againſt the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Expoſition</hi> of the Bishop
of <hi>Meaux.</hi> But withal, it will diſpleaſe and vex him to review
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the paſſages quotedout of Father <hi>Craſſet,</hi> and the
ſorry ſcribbles of ſuch <hi>Jeſuites</hi> as he, who are not at all to
his liking, and he would be glad never to ſee or hear any thing of' em.</p>
            <p>In this piece we give the true <hi>picture</hi> and
repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> as genuine and faithful as that is
falſe and flattering, which is of late made to the <hi>new Converts,</hi> by
the Gentlemen imployed in the famous Converſions in <hi>France.</hi> It is
compoſed of theſe <hi>thirteen</hi> lineaments, which compleat the picture,
or ſo many <pb facs="tcp:94715:5"/>
               <hi>Characters</hi> which deſcribe <hi>Popery,</hi>
conſidering it in it ſelf, as diſtinct from the Common Chriſtianity
that doth yet remain in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Let us then ſee what it
is.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> Firſt, 'tis a Kingdom altogether
<hi>Earthly,</hi> and after the Spirit of the World. This <hi>Beaſt</hi> is
as other Beaſts, which in the ſtile of Prophetick Scripture ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
Kingdoms and Empires. It hath its Capital City, its Monarch, Provinces,
Governours, Arms, Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, Tributes, &amp;c. and in one thing doth go beyond
all other Tyrants, that whereas their power reaches only to the Bodies of men,
the <hi>Papacy</hi> uſurps an Authority over the Conſcience, and the Souls
of men.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> 'Tis the effect of the moſt ſubile and yet
the moſt deteſtable <hi>Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>icy,</hi> by which any Worldly Empire was ever erected or
preſerved. Their <hi>Temporal</hi> Tyranny is vailed under the appearance of
<hi>Spirituality,</hi> and at the ſame time 'tis aſſiſted and
ſupported by it. As Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians to make up their Charms bring in the names of
God, and ſometimes of Baptiſm and the Euchariſt: ſo doth the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church make uſe of the words Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Sacraments, Church
Cenſures, Confeſſion of ſins, the ſeveral degrees of the Miniſtry,
&amp;c. as the Means to eſtablish a Kingdom and Government that is meerly
Humane and Worldly, and to exerciſe a power over the Bodies, the eſtates,
the lives, and Conſciences of men.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Proud Tyrant,</hi> who is ſeated
on a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifick Throne, and from thence cries aloud to the whole Earth, that he
is the Prophet of the Living God, the mouth which Speaks Oracles. Saying, <hi>I
am Queen, and ſhall ſee no ſorrow.</hi> I am ſeated in the Eternal
City, <hi>Rome;</hi> I am <hi>Infallible,</hi> and of my Dominion there shall
be no end. It belongs to me to beſtow the crowns of Paradiſe, and I am the
Soveraign Miniſter of the Living God upon Earth, as to Temporals. <pb facs="tcp:94715:5"/>I am the only Spouſe of Chriſt, always young, and beautifull,
without ſpot or blemish. This is the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the <hi>Popiſh
Church,</hi> who calls herſelf fair &amp; beautifull, tho it be the moſt
hideous &amp; deformed So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety that bears the Chriſtian name; and calls
herſelf <hi>Infallible</hi> in the midſt of numberleſs Errors, which make

            <p n="4">
               <hi>IV.</hi> 'Tis the Enemy of God, of his Religion and his
H. Word; that endeavours not a conformity to the rules he hath given in his
Word; making to themſelves another word of God, which they call
<hi>Tradition,</hi> which is altogether and directly oppoſite to the true
Word of God. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder pretence of making uſe of the H. <hi>Scripture,</hi>
they wretchedly abuſe and wreſt it. Applying Scripture to all their falſe
and foolish My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, without either reaſon or Conſcience: and by
ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous and impious applications of Scripture, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it to the
deriſion of the Profane, &amp; to the contempt and ſcorn of Infidels.</p>
            <p>They maim and curtail it, and impudently falſifie and pervert
it; and leſt all this be not enough, they ſpeak as ill things of it as can
be ſaid of any book: This <hi>Book,</hi> they ſay, is Imperfect, 'tis
obſcure, 'tis full of ſnares, 'tis the ſource of Hereſies, it abounds
with Contradictions, it contains an hundred things whoſe out ſide is proper
to ſcandalize the weak, it is inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, one half of it is loſt, it
hath no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity without the <hi>Church,</hi> any more than the Hiſtory of
<hi>Titus Livius.</hi> Laſtly, the <hi>Papacy</hi> makes uſe of the
<hi>Scripture</hi> as if it were its own, they abrogate the Laws of God laid
down in the Scripture, they grant diſpenſation contrary to thoſe Laws,
they command that which the H. Scripture forbids, and forbid that which it
enjoyns: and to make it evident that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> is indeed the Enemy
of God, it always ſtands upon its guard to reſiſt the force of Scripture,
&amp; defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <pb facs="tcp:94715:6"/>againſt the word of God, by their
Diſtinctions.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Head</hi> of that Religion hath diſcovered ſuch a

and Sorcerers: Some have been ſeen, who were Profane, Atheiſtical, without

plung'd into the ſame diſorders, following the Example of their Head, and
treading in the ſteps of their Leader; Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, Impious, debaucht,

fleshly Luſts. Their <hi>Convents</hi> of men and women, which they call
Retirements from the world, and little forts and caſtles of Holineſs,
theſe I ſay, have been obſerved to be as bad as the moſt infamous
places of proſtitution for all manner of debauchery. Laſtly, their
<hi>People</hi> alſo were carried away with this fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Torrent of

Chriſt is not the Meſſiah; <hi>Omne ſimile eſt diſſimile,</hi>
all the <hi>Prophecies</hi> are riddles, and on that account have ſome

tolerable Judgment to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand'em, will quickly diſcern what may be
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and they who ſee it not, will not be leſs wiſe or happy on that

In the Prophetick Viſions, <hi>Beast</hi> ſignifies a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi>

repreſented.</p>
               <p>V. 1. <hi>And I ſaw a Beaſt riſe up, out of the ſea,

               </p>
               <p>V. 11. <hi>And I beheld another Beaſt, coming out of the

               <p>V. 14. <hi>Saying to them that dwell on the Earth, that they
should make an Image to the Beaſt, which had the wound by a Sword, and yet
did live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This plainly ſignifies, that <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi>
muſt exerciſe a <hi>Temporal Power,</hi> reſembling that of the firſt
<hi>Empire,</hi> in whoſe place it comes. This being notorious and
confeſs'd; 'tis not neceſſary to inſiſt larger upon it. At preſent
we muſt ſee, how this is found in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi> in which
<hi>Religion, Church,</hi> and <hi>State</hi> are mingled and hid one under

ought ſtudiouſly to avoid the expreſſions, and terms, which cannot but
raiſe in our minds ſuch Idea's, as muſt be diſadvantagious to them;
ſuch an one is the <hi>term</hi> of <hi>Human Policy.</hi> Certainly they

that, which prevails in this <hi>Empire:</hi> but 'tis too great an honour to
call it, <hi>A merely Human Policy;</hi> for it is really <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical.</hi>
And in this I find the <hi>ſecond</hi> Character of

on the minds of the people.</hi> 'Twas in vain, that <hi>Boniface VIII.</hi>
put on his Pontifical Robes at <pb n="16" facs="tcp:94715:20"/>
                  <hi>Anagina;</hi>
notwithſtanding this, his Jawes were brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a blow of a Gantlet, and
he thruſt into Priſon. 'Twas therefore neceſſary to joyn a ſecond
<hi>policy</hi> to the former, and ſupport this falsly named
<hi>Spiritual</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion with a Worldly Pomp, and Grandeur. Men are
compounded of Fleſh and Blood, the Paſſions are ever the prevailing
Party, and the ſenſes are the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, which bear the chief ſway in
the conduct of men. 'Twas therefore neceſſary (to maintain this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion)
that men ſhould ſee ſomething, that affects the ſenſes, and engageth
the Paſſions. Therefore it hath been the <hi>Policy</hi> of that Spirit,
which framed this Engine, to heap together vaſt <hi>Treaſures,</hi> to have
ſtately <hi>Palaces,</hi> to change <hi>Prieſts</hi> into ſecular
<hi>Princes,</hi> to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with greath Revenues, with pompous
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, with ſumptuous Tables, and indeed with every thing that belongs to
Worldly Glory.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Policy</hi> is owned by the conſiderable perſons of
the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> you need only read, what hath been written by
<hi>Pallavicino</hi> in his Hiſtory of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> of
<hi>Trent,</hi> and the Collection out of him, drawn up by another Author of
the ſame Religion, in an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Book, called, <hi>The new Goſpel of
Cardinal Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicino.</hi> There it is ſhewn, that the <hi>Cardinal</hi>
makes it a matter of neceſſity, that the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the
<hi>Church,</hi> ſhould be Rich, and Wealthy; ſhould have Palaces,
Benefices, Princes, who are equall to ſecular <hi>Princes.</hi> We cannot
doubt, that this <hi>Policy</hi> hath been of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable uſe to the
<hi>Antichriſtian Monarchy:</hi> for 'tis certain, that if the <hi>Bishops of
Rome,</hi> had continued <hi>poor,</hi> (as they were for the <hi>three</hi>
firſt Ages of the <hi>Church</hi>) they had never made themſelves Maſters
of the World. Thunderbolts iſſuing forth from a Cottage, or a Tent, would
not long have aſtoniſht men. But co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the <hi>Vatican,</hi> from a
<hi>Palace,</hi> that in poynt of ſplendour, may diſpute with the moſt

indeed ſomething real in thoſe painted Thunderbolts.</p>
               <p>The Authors of the <hi>Logick</hi> of <hi>Port-Royal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Part 3. cap. 19.</note> have made a judicious remarque, <hi>No man
doth expreſly argue at this rate, ſuch a one hath ten thouſand
pounds</hi> per annum; <hi>therefore he is in the right: He is of a Noble
Familie, therefore we muſt believe every thing he ſaith. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
ſomething like this rate of arguing is found in the minds of moſt men,
which unawares corrupts their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c. They approve every thing,
done or ſpoken by a Great man, through a ſecret condeſcenſion of mind,
which bowes down under the weight of Grandeur, and wants Courage to look it in
the face.</hi> This is the very Method, that the Papacy hath uſed to gain the
minds of men: which being once gain'd by this Pomp of Riches, and Worldly
Grandeur, have argued at this rate; <hi>The</hi> Pope <hi>is a great Prince,
therefore be is in the right, therefore he hath Authority to do, as he
doth.</hi> Yea, this very thing hath helped to delude the <hi>Popes</hi>
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: A Great Perſon, who taketh no pains to rectify the
impreſſions, which his ſecular Grandeur makes on his mind, is eaſily
brought to believe, that he excels other men as much in moral and intellectual
Qualit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as he doth in Riches and Dignitie: Thus the <hi>Popes</hi> ſeeing
themſelves to be ſerved as Kings, and adored as Gods, have eaſily
believed, that they have a rightful Authority over the whole World.</p>

an Art to make themſelves Maſters of Families, and Conſciences. They
inſpire all their Diſciples with Maximes of Submiſſion, and Slavery, to

wayes imaginable, the <hi>Flesh,</hi> the <hi>Paſſions,</hi> and
<hi>Senſes;</hi> by making eaſy Laws, and ſuting them to corrupt
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, by ſending out every where looſe Directors of Conſcience,

of Rome;</hi> Diſpenſations to marry within the prohibited De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; to
enjoy Biſhopricks, without having the Age, or qualities which are required;
Indulgences for the moſt horrid crimes; Relaxations of Pennances, and the
ſetting a <hi>rate</hi> upon all ſins. Laſtly, from hence 'tis, that care
hath been taken to provide all the Pleaſures for the Fleſh which it
deſires. Cardinal <hi>Pallavicin</hi> in this Hiſtory of the <hi>Council of
Trent,</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Form</hi> muſt be ſuted to the
<hi>Matter,</hi> and ſuch Lawes made as agree with <hi>Times</hi> and

to Idleneſs, Exceſſive Eating and Drinking, Playes, yea Stewes, which are
allowed at <hi>Rome.</hi> And that the <hi>Church</hi> may be able to triumph
over <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> which held men by the Pleaſures of Senſe, ſhe
muſt furniſh them with thoſe that are more exquiſite and delicious than
thoſe of Paganiſm.</p>
               <p>'Tis from the ſame deſign of pleaſing the <hi>Fleth</hi>
and the <hi>Senſes,</hi> that the External Pomp in Worſhip proceeds.
Becauſe men love <hi>Playes, Theaters,</hi> and the Pleaſures of Senſe;
the Policy of <hi>Rome</hi> hath intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced all theſe into
<hi>Religion,</hi> that She may engage them to herſelf by thoſe things, of
which alone they are ſenſible. <hi>Churches</hi> are ſplendidly adorn'd,
they glitter with Gold; their Lights are ordered with great care; thoſe that
ſerve at the Altars draw <pb n="21" facs="tcp:94715:22"/>mens Eyes by the pomp of their
Veſtments, in them Muſiek ſounds, and flatters the ears. They make
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, which are a marching in Triumph after the mode of the Pagan
<hi>Romans.</hi> Yea, their very Funerals have Pomp, that ſo even death
itſelf, may afford pleaſure. 'Twas once a very difficult matter, to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Luſt</hi> together. But the

                  <hi>A Marryed Woman,</hi> looking upon a <hi>Prieſt</hi> as
the Confident of her Diſloyalties, and the Witneſs of her Diſorders,
trembles at his Preſence, and can refuſe him nothing. A <hi>husband,</hi>
that hath diſcloſed to a <hi>Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> all the Violations of his

Occaſions, when there are but two heads together, the <hi>Priests</hi> ſay
what they pleaſe, they wind about the Conſcience, according to their own
deſigns, and Intereſts, they rack, they looſe, they bind, they terrify,
they aſtoniſh, they flatter it. And by theſe different Methods, they lead
it, where it had no Intention to go. God knows, and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath told us

Policy. All <pb n="22" facs="tcp:94715:23"/>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">8 Policy; a great exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

<hi>Severity</hi> and <hi>Rigour.</hi> For men are willing to give ſomething
to God, and not being able to give him <hi>Fruit,</hi> they are willing to pay
him in <hi>Leaves.</hi> Therefore they love thoſe Cuſtoms, which have a
great ſhew of Mortification. You cannot rid men of this notion, that the
<hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> is a ſerious thing, and an Enemy to the
Pleaſures of the World. Therefore if the <hi>Papacy</hi> was licentious in
all reſpects, and held no correſpondence with the Temper of
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> it would be impoſſible, but men would quickly ſee
through it. Therefore it endeavours to keep up a great Appearance of
Seriouſneſs, in the midſt of its innumerable Villanies. It ordains above
a hundred and ſixty <hi>Faſts</hi> in a year; men eat, and drink on theſe
Faſts, as at other times, provided they chooſe ſuch a diet. But no
matter, they are always call'd <hi>Faſts,</hi> and this makes a great Figure
in the Outſide of <hi>Religion.</hi> From the ſame Policy, we have the
<hi>Penitents,</hi> and <hi>Whippers</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> who
tear themſelves with Blowes of a Whip, when they are hired to do it.</p>
               <p>Thence come the Cloiſters Frocks, Hair-ſhirts, Whippings,
Diſcipline, Confinement, Silence, Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and all the ſtrict and
ſevere Rules of the <hi>Monks.</hi> Such Rules and Orders as in ſhow and
appearance are very conſiderable; and gain them Reputation with the people,
but in reality they are not much incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded <pb n="23" facs="tcp:94715:23"/>by 'em, and
ſuffer little by their obſervance, as to any thing of that ſeverity and
mortification they pretend to, becauſe they are <hi>Maſters</hi> of their
own <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and comply with them no farther than they think good.</p>
               <p>If after this we ſhould examin the whole conduct of the
<hi>Papacy,</hi> it will appear altogether conformable to that ſpirit of
<hi>humane policy,</hi> whereby the whole body is compounded, and all its parts
united. When any difference in Religion comes to be determin'd, provided that
the perſons whoſe different Opinions are under examination are favorable to
the <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> all their <hi>Hereſies</hi> are but trivial
Miſtakes; but if they are leſs bigotted for the <hi>Pope,</hi> all their
Opinions deſerve an Anathema. <hi>Grace by it ſelf efficacious</hi> is
ſound doctrine in the <hi>Jacopins,</hi> but down-right Hereſy in the
<hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> the plain reaſon is, becauſe theſe latter are
enemies to the <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> as well
as to its Tyranny. Becauſe the <hi>Protestants</hi> are Adverſaries to the
<hi>Pope,</hi> they muſt be <hi>Hereticks,</hi> in the Article concerning the
<hi>Trinity,</hi> and that of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation</hi> of Chriſt. They
muſt err mortally, when they ſay that Concupiſcence is a ſin
notwithſtanding Baptiſm, and the marriage bond is diſſolved by
Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</p>
               <p>Let us look into the <hi>Popish Councils,</hi> and we ſhall
evidently diſcover this Spirit of <hi>Human Policy;</hi> there we may ſee
all the Arts, and Tricks, and Devices, that are in uſe in the World, for men
to gain what they deſire, and reach the ends they aim at. All the world hath
obſerv'd this in the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> 'tis every where complain'd
of, and all men conſent to the truth of what was ſaid by the
<hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Lanſac</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador,
<hi>that the Holy-Ghost, who was invok't at the opening of that Council, came
every week from Rome in a Cloak-bag with the poſt letters.</hi> It hath often
been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, <pb n="24" facs="tcp:94715:24"/>that the conduct of that
<hi>Councill</hi> was altogether by the ſpirit of <hi>Worldly Bolicy,</hi>
and had nothing at all of the Character of a Divine ſpirit: and yet thoſe
<hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> which were forg'd by the Tricks of Humane Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, muſt be
obtruded on us as Divine Deciſions from the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>In a word, if we would ſee the <hi>Politiques</hi> of the
<hi>Roman Church</hi> in the ſource and fountain, and upon the Threne, we
need but go to <hi>Rome.</hi> All the <hi>Courts</hi> in the World, how refined
and ſubtle ſoever, are but meer Blockiſhneſs and Stupidity, in
compariſon of that of the <hi>Pope.</hi> Cardinal <hi>Pallavicin</hi>
mentions this to the honour of his Religion: pretending, that <hi>Policy</hi>
is the Principal of all moral vertues,, and that the <hi>Church</hi> ought to
be govern'd according to the <hi>Politicks</hi> of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> and

               <p>The <hi>ſecond fault</hi> to be found with this pretence of
<hi>Infallibility</hi> and eternal Duration, is the multitude of <hi>groſs

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Abſurdities contain'd in the doctrine of

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> 'tis ſuppoſed without any ſhow of

ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation into two parts, and cut off one half of it. There are two ways
which lead to Heaven, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> ſound Belief, and
Good Works:<note place="margin">Firſt an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility in matters of Faith,
and not of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> 'Tis in vain to pretend to be <hi>infallible</hi>
in the one, if without being ſo in the other a man may periſh, and fall
ſhort of Heaven. The <hi>Church of Rome</hi> hath not the Impudence to ſay
ſhe is <hi>infallible</hi> in the point of <hi>Charity;</hi> and yet ſhe
would be thought ſo in matters of <hi>Faith.</hi> But on what foundation doth
ſhe build this Pretence? Where do we read that God hath divided
<hi>Faith</hi> from <hi>Charity,</hi> as if the latter were leſs
neceſſary than the former? as if men might be ſaved who ſinn'd
againſt the <hi>Laws of Charity,</hi> but might not be ſo, if they offended

certain, to guide us to eternal Life: as if God might diſpenſe with
<hi>Crimes</hi> againſt <hi>Charity,</hi> but could not bear with
<hi>Errors</hi> againſt the <hi>Truth:</hi> All or nothing, both or neither;
The <hi>Church</hi> muſt be <hi>infallible</hi> in both, or it is ſo in
neither. Whence comes this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Diviſion? why dae not the <hi>Roman
Church</hi> pretend to be <hi>infallible</hi> in Charity, as well as Faith? but
becauſe ſhe is convinc't of an abominable Defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Diſorder in
Manners and Practice? but ought ſhe not to be equally convinc't that ſhe is
fallen into Error, becauſe ſhe worſhips <hi>Images?</hi> An Error in the
<hi>Faith</hi> every whit as palpable and notorious, as the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domies</hi>
of the <hi>Popes</hi> is againſt <hi>Charity.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Infallibility in points of Right and not in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact is

               </p>
               <p>Another diviſion of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> is with reſpect
to matters of <hi>Fact,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Right.</hi> The <hi>Church of
Rome</hi> dares not pretend to the former, but challengeth <pb n="28" facs="tcp:94715:26"/>the latter: at this rate ſhe will not be infallible in the moſt
important Articles. All the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> is founded on matters
of <hi>Fact.</hi> 'Tis a queſtion of Fact to know whether Jeſus Chriſt be
riſen from the Dead, whether the Apoſtles wrought any true Miracles,
whether there have been any Prophets and inſpired writers who were the penmen
of ſuch and ſuch books or not. 'Tis concerning a matter of Fact to enquire
whether ſuch a Propoſition be recorded in the H. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or not. If
the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> be not infallible in matters of Fact in general,
ſhe cannot be ſo in theſe; and if ſhe may err in matters of Fact,
wherein lies her <hi>Infallibility?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> there is yet another diviſion of
<hi>Infallibility,</hi> viz. as to <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and
<hi>Doctrines.</hi> The <hi>Roman Church</hi> pretends not to
<hi>Infallibility</hi> concerning the latter. What is that Diſcipline wherein
ſhe ſaith, ſhe is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible? 'Tis in every thing that concerns the
Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Church.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy, the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting of a <hi>Pope</hi> to be the Head of the <hi>Church,</hi> is a
point of Government: ſhe may err concerning that which is a Principal point,
and why then may ſhe not err in other matters?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſeat of this Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility connot be

conſider the <hi>ſubject</hi> of it, in whom it reſides. Where and in
whom is this <hi>Infallibility</hi> plac't? they know not what reply to make:
If it be ſaid in the <hi>Pope;</hi> we can produce an hundred <hi>Popish
Witneſſes,</hi> who depoſe the contrary, and maintain that the
<hi>Popes</hi> may err. We can produce with them numberleſs Inſtances,
wherein ſeveral <hi>Popes</hi> have actually err'd: we can bring undeniable
proofs to manifeſt, that neither the Scripture nor the ancient Chriſtian
Church did ever imagine the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other
Biſhop, to have been infallible. One part of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi>
aſſert, that this <hi>Infallibility</hi> is ſeated in the
<hi>Councills.</hi> We confute this Party with the <pb n="29" facs="tcp:94715:26"/>reaſons of the other; for thoſe Gentlemen are Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble when
they confute one another, but ſpeak nothing to the purpoſe when they go
about to eſtabliſh their own opinion: for when they oppoſe one another,
they argue for the <hi>Truth;</hi> but when they endeavor to prove their own
Opinion concerning the ſeat of <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility,</hi> they maintain a
<hi>falshood.</hi> So that the <hi>Pope</hi> is not Infallible, neither the
<hi>Councills;</hi> their <hi>infallibility</hi> then is no where; for if it be
ſaid it is in the <hi>Pope</hi> and a <hi>Councill</hi> united together, we
ſhall make uſe of their Arguments, who ſay it is not in the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and their Reaſons who deny it is in a <hi>Councill,</hi> and
will therupon argue, that if it be not in either ſeparated, it is not in both
when joyn'd together: for both united are the ſame they were in the time of
their ſeparation: they act by the ſame ſpirit, make uſe of the ſame
Tricks to deceive, the ſame Injuſtice and Violence as when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
ſeverally.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">We know not where to ſtop, as to the point
of Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note>
                  <hi>Infallibility</hi> then is fooliſh and abſurd,
whether we conſider the ſubject about which it is imploy'd, or the
ſubject in whom it is thought to reſide. But let us view it a little in the
general notion of it, and in the general term of <hi>the Church,</hi> which
they make uſe of. The <hi>Church is Infallible,</hi> they ſay; but how
ſhall I be aſſured of this? for ſhould the Church be never ſo
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, if I know it not, and have no way to aſcertain my ſelf about
it, it can be of no uſe to me. Is it a Principle ſo ſelf-evident as needs
no other proof to manifeſt and evince it? Is it as plain that the <hi>Church
is Infallible,</hi> as that two and two make four, or that the whole is greater
than a part? That is an Abſurdity too groſs and palpable to be affirm'd by
any <hi>Romaniſt.</hi> 'Tis ſo far from being evident, that the Church is
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, that on the contrary, we muſt proceed againſt all appearances
of reaſon to believe it. For we ſee the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> doth judge
by humane methods, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, <pb n="30" facs="tcp:94715:27"/>conteſt, urge, ſollicit,
equivovate, and deceive, and imploy all the arts of Human Craft and Policy, to
overcome ſuch or ſuch an Opinion. We ſee her oftentimes to change her
ſentiments, and ſay that at one time, which ſhe did not, and would not at
another; we ſee her contradict the H. Scriptures, forbid that which is there
commanded, and command that which is there forbidden: at leaſt ſhe ſeems
to do ſo. This appearance of oppoſing the H. Scripture will at leaſt
refute the evidence of her <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and tell us, that it is not
ſo plain, but that 'tis neceſſary it ſhould be Prov'd.</p>
               <p>Now from whence ſhall we fetch the Proofs of the <hi>Churches
Infallability?</hi> I muſt take them from her own mouth, and believe her to
be <hi>infallible,</hi> becauſe ſhe tells me ſo, and for that only
reaſon, becauſe ſhe ſaith it. This is manifeſtly abſurd, for no
man's bare word is to be taken in a buſineſs, wherein he hath a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Intereſt to be partial. Hath a <hi>Turk</hi> right to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me to believe
the Divinity of his <hi>Alchoran,</hi> only becauſe <hi>Mahomet</hi> hath
ſaid, that the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> brought him the <hi>Alchoran</hi> from
Heaven? Muſt I then conſult <hi>Tradition,</hi> that is, the Councils, and
the Writings of the <hi>Fathers?</hi> this is another plain Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
becauſe it is evident, that this way cannot be made uſe of by three
Quarters of the number of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> and more, who are ignorant of
<hi>Greck</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> and ſo cannot read the numberleſs
volumns, wherein this <hi>Tradition</hi> is to be found. Or muſt every one
believe his <hi>Curate</hi> or <hi>Paſtor,</hi> when he tells him, that the
<hi>Church is infallible?</hi> This is another Abſurdity: for this
<hi>Pastor</hi> muſt be <hi>infallible,</hi> or I cannot build my Faith upon
his Teſtimony. He tells me, there is an <hi>infallibility</hi> in the
<hi>Church;</hi> but how doth he Prove it? which way ſoever I turn my ſelf,
I fall into the former inconveniencies: for if he ſaith, I muſt believe it 
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94715:27"/>without proof, he deals with me like a Brute, and not as a
Rational Creature: If he gives me <hi>Tradition</hi> for Argument in this
caſe; I tell him, I know nothing of it: if he turns me over to the
<hi>Church;</hi> I ask, <hi>where is this Church?</hi> If he ſends me to the
<hi>Pope;</hi> I tell him, I cannot go thither, and if I could, I'm told he is
not <hi>Infallible:</hi> If he ſend me to a <hi>Councill,</hi> I ſay there
is none now ſitting: If he ſend me to the <hi>Canons</hi> of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Councills, I ſhall anſwer, that I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand 'em, and if I could
have no aſſurance, that theſe <hi>Canons</hi> were really made by ſuch
a <hi>Councill.</hi> If he proves that theſe <hi>Canons</hi> were not forged,
but really made by a <hi>Councill,</hi> there remains another difficulty, which
I cannot get over, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſeveral Good Catholicks maintain the
<hi>fallibility</hi> of a <hi>Council.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is then but one way left to ſatisfie my ſelf
concerning <hi>the infallibility of the Church;</hi> and that is, the
<hi>Teſtimony of the H. Scriptures.</hi> But how can any man make uſe of
that according to the <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church?</hi> for I
ſhall ſay, that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> have no Authority without the
<hi>Church;</hi> I cannot believe the teſtimony of the <hi>Scripture,</hi>
till I know it to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; and I cannot know it to be divine but by the
teſtimony of the <hi>Church,</hi> as we are often told. The
<hi>Scripture</hi> then hath no Authority, as to me, without the Teſtimony of
the <hi>Church:</hi> and yet you would have me believe the
<hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> upon the Teſtimony of the
<hi>Scripture:</hi> you muſt therefore in the firſt place convince me that
the <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>infallible,</hi> without dependance on the
<hi>Scriptures,</hi> and then I ſhall believe the divinity of the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> on the Teſtimony of the <hi>Church,</hi> and after that I
may be able to believe the <hi>infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> on the
Teſtimonies of the <hi>Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of blind
obedience.</note>If the <hi>Church</hi> be infallible, <hi>a blind
Obedience</hi> is my Duty; to obtain this ſubmiſſion to the Church is 
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94715:28"/>the reaſon of aſſerting her <hi>infallibility.</hi> I
muſt blindly believe all that the <hi>Church</hi> affirms. But till then I am
not obliged to credit any thing which the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſaith, or
ſeems to ſay; for I am not capable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the meaning and
ſenſe of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Church,</hi> ſo that
until the Church hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Eternal Son of
God, and equal with the Father, I have leave to doubt of it. There was a time
when the <hi>Church</hi> had not deliver'd her opinion in this point; there was
then a time, when I was permitted to be an <hi>Arrian, Photinian,</hi> or
<hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian.</hi> But on the other hand, whenever it ſhall pleaſe the
<hi>Church</hi> to determine that the <hi>Ark</hi> was of a ſquare figure,
equal in length and breadth, or that <hi>Aaron's</hi> Sandals were with, or
without latchets, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that I muſt believe this, or be
damn'd. Can any man be unapprehenſive of the abſurdities of ſuch a
Doctrine, according to which, at one time we may Blaſpheme God without the
leaſt danger, and at another time lie liable to Damnation for the leaſt
miſtake about that which the <hi>Church</hi> hath decided to be the Truth?
Theſe Gentlemen tell us, <hi>that we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve without examination all
that the Church declares:</hi> And by the ſame reaſon the <hi>Heathens</hi>
were obliged to believe all that their <hi>Prieſts</hi> told'um; and the
<hi>Jews</hi> to receive all that was taught in their <hi>Synagogues.</hi> No,
you will ſay, they were falſe Teachers, and ſo not to be credited very
well: But the <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> ſay the ſame concerning my
<hi>Paſtors,</hi> that they are falſe Guides. And if the <hi>Jews</hi> and
<hi>Heathens</hi> are bound to examin the truth of what is told them by their
Guides, why are not <hi>Chriſtians</hi> obliged to know and examin what is
told them by the <hi>Church?</hi> at leaſt they ought to examin the
<hi>Church</hi> it ſelf and her Authority, and then we fall into the ſame
Difficulties which were men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd before.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:94715:28"/>
               <p>After all this, if a ſhort and eaſy way could be found out
to convince me, that <hi>the Church is infallible,</hi> this were not enough to
quiet my mind; becauſe <hi>I know not where to find this infallible
Church.</hi> I ſee a multitude of differing <hi>Sects</hi> in the
<hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt,</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi>
who all ſay, <hi>that they are the Church;</hi> and that all other parties of
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> are guilty of <hi>Schiſm?</hi> The <hi>Latins</hi>
ſay this of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the <hi>Greeks</hi> are even with'em,
and ſay the ſame of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins;</hi> the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> charge
it on the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> on the
<hi>Proteſtants.</hi> I muſt know which of all theſe is in the right, and
to find out this I am plung'd into an abyſſe of difficulties; and how
ſhall I find my way out, or extricate my ſelf? for there is no way left but
by the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and that way is forbidden me, till I am aſſured
of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> and Authority of the <hi>Church,</hi> without
which I cannot be certain that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is divine. It may
poſſibly be ſaid, that I may believe the Divinity of the Scriptures,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I know in what <hi>Sect</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> is the Church;
becauſe the Scripture is receiv'd by all the ſeveral <hi>Sects.</hi> It
matters not, may it be ſaid, which of them is the infallible Church, ſince
they all bear reſtimony to the Scripture, and there is one among them that is
infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>viz. the true Church;</hi> for her, where-ever ſhe be, the
Scripture hath an infallible teſtimony.</p>
               <p>But this remedy will ſerve to little or no purpoſe,
becauſe 'tis neceſſary that I ſhould know which of theſe
<hi>Sects</hi> is the true Church, before I can underſtand the true ſenſe
of Scripture, one ſect interpreting it one way, and another ſect in a
different manner. So that I cannot be diſcharg'd from the obligation to
inquire after the true Church among the many differing Sects and to ſearch
for it in ſome way different and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant from that of the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Upon all that I have ſaid I would make theſe two 
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94715:29"/>Reflections, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that this pretence of
<hi>Infallibility</hi> on the one hand, is the character of <hi>Myſtical
Babylon,</hi> who boaſts of her being alway <hi>Queen,</hi> and that ſhe
ſhall never ſee ſorrow; on the other hand, that 'tis full of
Abſurdities and Inconſiſtencies. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that this
<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian,</hi> falſe, and inconſiſtent <hi>Principle,</hi>
according to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> is the great fundamental
<hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> I wiſh men would reaſon a
little upon theſe two <hi>Reflections</hi> in ſome ſuch manner as this.
If God hath beſtowed on the <hi>Church</hi> the priviledge of
<hi>Infallibility,</hi> 'tis one of the beſt and greateſt advantages that
can be, 'tis the Baſis of <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> now it is not plain or
probable that God ſhould give for the ground of his <hi>Religion</hi> ſuch
a principle, loaded with ſo many difficulties on the one hand, and on the
other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a pretention, which the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſpeaks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of, ſave in the mouth of the falſe Prophet, and <hi>Antichrist.</hi> This
pretended <hi>Infallibility</hi> ſhould have been as clear as a Sun upon an
high Mountain to give light to all the Faithful at the greateſt diſtance.
But inſtead of being ſo, 'tis an ocean of impaſſible Darkneſs. The
wiſdom of God would not have ſuffer'd ſuch a Truth to be clog'd with ſo
many abſurdities, which being the principal and foundation of all others,
ought to have been the cleareſt, and diſcernable by the moſt
Ignorant.</p>
               <p>It muſt not be ſaid, that 'tis the fate of the
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Articles to ſhow great Depths and Myſteries in the
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties which attend 'em, and produce the Articles of the
<hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Incarnation</hi> for Examples. For we muſt carefully
diſtinguiſh thoſe <hi>Truths</hi> which we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve from the
<hi>Principle</hi> for the ſake whereof we ought to believe 'um. It is not
neceſſary that the Truths we are to believe ſhould be diſintangl'd from
Difficulties; 'tis ſufficient if the Authority or Teſtimony on which we
give credit to 'um be not obſcure, or at leaſt have <pb n="35" facs="tcp:94715:29"/>ſufficient light to manifeſt it ſelf to a free and unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd
mind. Such is the <hi>H. Scripture,</hi> whoſe Divinity and true Meaning are
viſible to all thoſe whoſe eyes are inlighten'd by the Grace of God.
Whereas this Principle of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> is
viſible to none, but ſuch whoſe eyes are ſhut by their own

is an exact accompliſhment of what was foretold concerning her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And she shall open her mouth in Blaſphemies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Revel. 13. v. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>even to Blaſpheme against God, and
his Tabernacle, and thoſe who dwell in Heaven.</hi> This pretence of
Perpetuity and Infallibility, which ſhe bears on her forehead, is <hi>the
name of Blaſphemy,</hi> that is writ on the head of the Beaſt. But the
manner after which ſhe vilifies and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuls the H. Scripture, is in words
full of Blaſphemy. 1. <hi>Againſt God:</hi> for the H. Ghoſt who
inſpired thoſe ſacred Writings, is infinitely affronted and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by
it. 2. <hi>Againſt his Tabernacle:</hi> for this H. Scripture is the
Dwelling-place of God and his H. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the Ark from whence he ſpeaks
between the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims, the Temple whence he gives forth his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. 
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94715:30"/> 3. <hi>And againſt thoſe who dwell in Heaven:</hi> for
the Bleſſed Prophets and H. Apoſtles, who were the Organs of the H.
Spirit, are greatly affronted by her treating their Writings after ſuch a
manner. This <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> proceeding of the <hi>Papacy</hi>
againſt the <hi>H. Scripture</hi> may be reduc't to three Articles. 1. Their
Contempt and neglect of the Scripture. 2. Their Abuſe and ill uſe of it. 3.
The out-rage they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit againſt it by Falſe Accuſations: for
<hi>Popery</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects and ſlights the word of God, and hath no eſteem
or value for it: They miſerably abuſe and wreſt it: and laſtly, they
accuſe it of many faults.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Popery en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to avoid any conformity to
the H. Scripture.</note>I ſay then in the firſt place, that 'tis the true
Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> to take no care to comply with the Rule of
<hi>Christianity.</hi> Every <hi>Religion</hi> hath its proper <hi>Books:</hi>
the <hi>Jews</hi> have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> for theirs;
the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> have their <hi>Alchoran;</hi> and the <hi>Pagans</hi>
had their ſacred <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Rituals,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it their
duty to be exactly Conformable to 'em. If the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould rebuild a
Temple, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in practiſe ſuch Cuſtoms and Ceremonies, as had no
agreement at all with the <hi>Law of Moſes,</hi> we might with juſtice tell
'em, you are not of the Religion that you profeſs, for your Worſhip and
Doctrines have no agreement with the Religion preſcribed in Your Law. If
among the ſeveral ſects into which the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> are divided,
there ſhould be any that pretending to receive the <hi>Alchoran,</hi>
ſhould yet have nothing like it, but altogether depart from it, would it not
be evident, that ſuch a <hi>Sect</hi> were not of the Religion of
<hi>Mahomet?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ought we not to argue after the ſame manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the
<hi>Papacy?</hi> You call your ſelves <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> let us ſee how
you prove it: if you ſay true, you ought to have ſome conformity with the
ſacred <hi>Books</hi> receiv'd by all <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> But if there be
no kind of <pb n="37" facs="tcp:94715:30"/>Conformity and Agreement between your Doctrines,
your Worſhip, your Religion, and that of J. Chriſt you are certainly
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> only in name, but in Truth and reality are
<hi>Antichriſtian.</hi> Now I dare aſſert, that there is no kind of
Conformity between <hi>Popery</hi> and the <hi>Laws</hi> of J. Chriſt: which
to me is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Character of <hi>Antichriſtianiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> 'tis true, hath no agreement with the Rule
of Chriſtians, and the Law of Chriſt; but it doth not pretend to have any,
and therefore cannot be charged with <hi>Antichriſtianiſm.</hi> But for
<hi>men</hi> to call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and yet neglect the
<hi>Laws</hi> of Chriſt, and have no agreement with the Chriſtian Rule,
this is to be <hi>Antichriſtian.</hi> For the <hi>Antichriſtian Church</hi>
is a falſe Church, an Harlot, who pretends to be the Spouſe of Chriſt,
who ſaith, <hi>I am no Widow, and shall never ſee ſorrow.</hi> Therefore
to confirm this Character, there needs nothing more than to prove, that
<hi>Popery</hi> hath no agreement with the H. Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">In the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Popery muſt be

<hi>Religion</hi> is conformable to the common <hi>Rule</hi> of all
Chriſtians, let them not inſtance in the Unity of one God, the adorable
Trinity of Perſons in the Godhead, the Incarnation of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon
in our nature, who is call'd J. Chriſt: His death, which was the Ranſom and
Redemption of mankind: his Reſurrection, which hath aſcertain'd ours: his
Aſcenſion, which hath open'd Heaven and made way for our admiſſion: his
ſitting at the Right hand of his Father, who hath conſtituted him Lord and
King of the Church and of the World: his Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which procures for
Believers all the good that is neceſſary to their Eternal
Bleſſedneſs: the Efficacy of the Redeemer's blood with reſpect to men:
The Life Everlaſting, the Reſurrection of the dead, and the laſt
Judgment. Let them not, I ſay, inſtance in any of <hi>theſe</hi> to prove
the agreement of their <hi>Religion</hi> 
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:94715:31"/>with the <hi>H.
Scripture,</hi> for 'tis not to the purpoſe. All that is
<hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and not <hi>Popery;</hi> 'tis my Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as well as
theirs. We know very well that <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> hath continued in the
<hi>Papacy;</hi> but we know likewiſe that <hi>Paganiſm</hi> hath been
built upon it in the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> and this is that which makes it
truly <hi>Antichriſtian. Popery</hi> is that which conſtitutes a particular
Sect, and diſtinguiſheth it from all others; and this we aſſert hath no
kind of Conformity to the Law of J. Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Sacriſice of the Maſs hath no

ſuch, becauſe it concerns the ſacrifice of a God unto God, thereby to
obtain Eternal Life, the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins, and all the bleſſings of
Heaven and Earth for mankind. Becauſe it treats of eſtabliſhing a new
Prieſthood, and new Prieſts, and ſuch as in the act of ſacrificing are
ſuperior to their own God, who is but a meer victim. Now in making this
Sacrifice, I aſſert, that they have altogether neglected and ſlighted the
<hi>H. Scripture;</hi> and had no regard at all to the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Law of

that the paſſages brought to prove the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſs</hi>

               <p>One would wonder how theſe Texts ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't as
Proofs in this caſe. Where is the Victim? where is the Prieſt? where are
the Ceremonies, the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, Elevation, Adoration, and Oblation of the

After the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> it naturally followes that we conſider the

<hi>Head</hi> of the Univerſal Church, a <hi>Vicar</hi> of J. Chriſt, a

put off to <hi>Tradition</hi> for the proof of ſuch an Article as this? what

Charge? This is alledged, <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and on this Rock will I
build my Church: and what thou haſt bound on earth shall be bound in Heaven:
feed my sheep: I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this is ſpoken by our L<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. to the Apoſtle

               <p>I would that a meer <hi>Turk,</hi> who is not prepoſſeſt
with the ſentiments of a particular ſect, might be our judge in this

that the objects of their Worſhip are to be found in the <hi>H.

This doth not diſtinguiſh <hi>Papiſts</hi> from other <hi>Christians</hi>

they ought to juſtifie from the <hi>H. Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now how can any have the impudence to aſſert, 
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94715:33"/>that the Worſhip of theſe is to be found in the
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? to prove that the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the Euchariſt, or
<hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Sacrament, ought to be worſhipt, they produce
neither precept, nor Example, but thoſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi>
which they think proves all; but indeed nothing. 'Tis Enough, they ſay, that
we know the Body of Chriſt is there, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low clearly that we muſt
adore it. If it were enough to declare the ſubject to teach us what Honour we
ought to pay to it, why did not the Father content himſelf to ſay of J.
Chriſt, <hi>This is my Son?</hi> why did he add, <hi>and let all the Angels
of God worship him; kiſs the Son, and pay him Homage.</hi> Thoſe
Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Bread, that to us ſeem to be Creatures in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and

               </p>
               <p>The Religious Invocation of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> and of the
<hi>Saints</hi> takes up more room in the <hi>Popish</hi> worship than the
Invocation of the true God. There are an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Chappells</hi> which bear
the names of <hi>Saints</hi> to one that is conſecrated unto <hi>God.</hi>
Where-ever we go, we ſee nothing but Devotions and Altars to the <hi>B.
Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> and the <hi>Saints; Pilgrimages</hi> are undertaken to ſerve and
invoke'em; <hi>Miracles</hi> are expected from them; great Deliverances wrought
by their means; and Thanks-givings accordingly return'd to 'em. Their
<hi>Churches</hi> reſound with Letanies, and <hi>Ora pro nobis's,</hi> much
more than with <hi>Hallelujah's.</hi> In every prayer to God the
<hi>Saints</hi> muſt make a part; for they add the <hi>Merits</hi> and
Interceſſions of the Saints, and pray to God to have regard to 'em, and for
their ſakes to ſhow <hi>Mercy:</hi> the <hi>Images</hi> of thoſe
<hi>Saints</hi> are expos'd to the Adoration of the <hi>People,</hi> in their
<hi>Churches,</hi> and even <pb n="43" facs="tcp:94715:33"/>upon their <hi>Altars:</hi>
yea, 'tis not enough to have them in their Temples, but they are plac't in the
Streets, and and in the moſt publick places. There they worſhip 'em, kneel
before 'em, and carry 'em in Triumph, offer Incenſe to 'em, and pay them all
ſort of divine honour. Should an <hi>Heathen</hi> or an <hi>Indian</hi> be
told, that there is not one word to this purpoſe in the <hi>Law of
Chriſtians,</hi> they could not believe it, and would reckon it prodigious
and unaccountable. This is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs true: and to manifeſt that it is
ſo, we need but look over the Proofs brought from Scripture, by the
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> to ſupport this Idolatrous Worſhip. For Example,
<hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let us kneel before the Lord, and worship before
his Foot-ſtool: Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> bowed down before the
<hi>Angels,</hi> who appeared to 'em in the form of Men, and they took them to

And <hi>Daniel</hi> prays for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of Mercy to <hi>Iſrael,
becauſe of</hi> Abraham <hi>whom he loved.</hi> Theſe are the proofs for
the <hi>Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints;</hi> and ſuch as theſe, that they kneeled
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Ark,</hi> upon which were the two <hi>Cherubims:</hi> that they
kneeled before the <hi>Serpent of Braſs:</hi> that God ſaid to <hi>Moſes,

                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:94715:34"/>therfore <hi>Images</hi> are holy, and we
may kneel before them.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Texts which are brought to prove the Invocation
of <hi>Saints</hi> and the worſhip of <hi>Images.</hi> Doth not this very
much reſemble that worſhip of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> wherin ſhe is called
<hi>the Redeemer of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> the <hi>Queen of Heaven,</hi> the
<hi>Gate</hi> of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> the <hi>Morning-ſtar,</hi> the
<hi>Goddeſs of Chriſtians, and the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Living and the
dead:</hi> wherin ſhe is prayed to, to give Grace, to grant Pardon, to Bind
and Looſe, to Save, to Heal, to Protect, to Deliver from Death, from Hell,
and the power of the Devil: wherin they build Temples to the honour of
<hi>Saints,</hi> conſecrate Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars to 'em, and ſacrifice the body of J.
Chriſt to their Honour: place their <hi>Images</hi> upon Altars, offer
incenſe to 'em, worſhip them, and expect Miracles from them, and render
them all ſort of Homage and Adoration. Is it not a ſtrange and horrible
blindneſs, that ſhould make men call this a Proof of ſuch Worſhip? Is
it not rather to proclaim, that they deſpiſe the <hi>H. Scripture,</hi> and
care not for any conformity to it?</p>
               <p>It would be too large to inſtance in all the Doctrines and
Worſhip of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and ſhew that they have no agreement
with the <hi>Scripture:</hi> let any man but conſider the Texts they bring

apparent, and manifeſt to all the World, let me make theſe two Reflections,
and let the Reader therin follow me.</p>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> By a Compariſon
of the <hi>whole Scripture,</hi> and all that we find there, with the whole
body of <hi>Popery;</hi> by thus comparing it in the groſs, we ſhall ſee
on the one hand the pompous ſhow of the <hi>Roman <pb n="45" facs="tcp:94715:34"/>Religion;</hi> her <hi>High Prieſt</hi> ſeated on a ſtately
Throne, with his three Crowns, calling himſelf the Supreme Judge of the
Church, a <hi>Vice-God,</hi> the <hi>Leiutenant</hi> of J. Chriſt, the
<hi>King</hi> of Kings; Magnificent <hi>Temples, Altars, Images,</hi> and
<hi>Worshippers,</hi> who bow down before Wood and Stone: <hi>Altars</hi> on
which men offer Sacrifice, with all the Equipage of thoſe Religions which do
moſt abound in Ceremonies: <hi>Prieſts,</hi> who are clothed in Myſtical
Habits, who perform a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Actions that ſavour of Pride, and are
ſaid to be full of Myſteries: Spiritual <hi>Judges,</hi> ſitting in
Chairs of Confeſſion, with Penitents at their feet, repeating all their
Crimes, and craving Abſolution. A <hi>Worship,</hi> wherein creatures are
joyn'd in the Praiſes of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, over which eſpecially they have
drawn the vail of an unknown Language, that the People and Fools may admire the
more what they do not underſtand: <hi>Proceſſions,</hi> wherin they carry
either the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the Altar, or <hi>Reliques,</hi> where
ſeveral fraternities march in State and great Pomp, where we ſee all the
world bow down to the Earth, and kiſs the Duſt, in honour of the Aſhes of
ſome one deceaſed, or of a <hi>Rag,</hi> which they call the Girdle or
Shift of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> or her <hi>Slipper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the other hand, let us caſt our eyes upon the <hi>New
Teſtament,</hi> and obſerve the Simplicity of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which is enjoyn'd
there; <hi>viz. Prayers,</hi> that are the moſt plain, and unadorned, which
have God alone for their Object; The breaking a little piece of <hi>Bread,</hi>

in the leaſt reſemble the magnificent and pompous Worſhip of
<hi>Popery,</hi> he will oblige us, by letting us know it. We ought not
therefore, only to compare the particular <hi>Doctrines</hi> and
<hi>Services</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> with particular paſſages of
<hi>Scripture;</hi> but 'tis uſeful, to make this Compariſon between the

                  <note place="margin">The Papacy is always on the defenſive
againſt the Scriptures.</note>The <hi>ſecond</hi> Reflection, which I would
have made upon this ſubject, reſpects <hi>the manner, how the Church of
Rome defends herſelf,</hi> againſt the Accuſation, which we have now
brought againſt her. We accuſe her for want of conformity in any meaſure
unto that <hi>Rule</hi> which is common to us both. The natural <hi>Method</hi>
of juſtifying herſelf, would be to take this <hi>ſacred Rule</hi> and
apply it to her <hi>Religion,</hi> to evidence their Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Indeed the
<hi>Papacy</hi> pretends a willingneſs to try this <hi>Method.</hi> But it
makes itſelf ridiculous in a moſt pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable manner, when it attempts to
find its <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Services</hi> in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
as we have even now proved. Accordingly it ſtayeth not here; its ſtrength
lyes in weakning all thoſe Teſtimonies of the Holy Writings, by which we
overthrow its <hi>Superſtitions, Idolatries,</hi> and <hi>Errors.</hi> You
alwayes find it on its guard, always on the defenſive againſt the
<hi>Scripture,</hi> alwayes wreſtling, alwayes winding, alwayes fighting in
retreat, always entrenching it ſelf in a bulwark which is called
<hi>Tradition.</hi> If you object againſt it the expreſs Law, which forbids
the making of <hi>Images,</hi> and bowing down to them; it diſtinguiſheth
between an <hi>Idol,</hi> and an <hi>Image;</hi> between the Images of falſe
<hi>Gods,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Saints.</hi> If you attaque it, with 
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94715:35"/>the often repeated Commandment, of ſerving none beſides
God, it ſaves it ſelf in the miſts which come forth from the pits of
<hi>Superstition</hi> and Barbarity, I mean the diſtinctions of <hi>Doulia,
Latria,</hi> and <hi>Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doulia.</hi> If you charge it with the impudent
wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of robbing the Laity of the uſe of the <hi>Cup,</hi> againſt
the expreſs Command, <hi>Drink ye all of it;</hi> it retreats to the
monſtrous terms of <hi>Tranſubstantiation</hi> and <hi>Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitance.</hi>
If you produce expreſs paſſages of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which ſay, that
Jeſus Chriſt was ſacrificed, and dyed <hi>but once;</hi> it
diſtinguiſheth between the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbloody,</hi> and the <hi>Bloody</hi>
Sacrifice. If you prove, that Chriſt hath fully ſatisfyed for our ſins;
it diſtinguiſheth between Eternal, and Temporal Puniſhments. If you
unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyably make it out, by Scripture, that there is but <hi>one Head of the
Church;</hi> they run to a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>Miniſterial</hi> and
<hi>Principal</hi> Head. If you ſhow them that the <hi>forbidding to marry,
and commanding to abſtain from meats,</hi> are characters of the
<hi>Doctrines of Devils,</hi> according to <hi>S. Paul;</hi> they
diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an <hi>Abſtinence</hi> which proceeds from
averſion, out of an Opinion that ſome Meats are unclean; and an
Abſtinence, out of a mere deſign to mortify ones ſelf. If you bring them
plain Texts, which ſay in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms, that <hi>divine Worship is not to
be performed in an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown Tongue;</hi> they wreſt them, by ſaying, that
we muſt diſtinguiſh between <hi>Holy,</hi> and <hi>Profane</hi>
Languages. In a word, go quite thro <hi>Popery,</hi> obſerve its combats, you
will ſee it every where defending itſelf, by diſtinguiſhing and warding
off the Rule of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which attaques it. If ever there was a
Character of <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> this is one:
<hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> and <hi>Antiſcriptural,</hi> have a very great
agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There is no <hi>Sect,</hi> which deſerves the <hi>ſecond</hi>
Title, more than the <hi>Papacy,</hi> therefore it is the <hi>former.</hi> If
the <hi>Papacy</hi> only had the misfortune, of <pb n="48" facs="tcp:94715:36"/>not finding
Supports in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and that we could find nothing in them, to
bring againſt it; we ſhould ſtand almoſt on equal terms with it, and
ought to ſeek ſome other Judge: But the <hi>Roman Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> finds
nothing in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to ſupport itſelf; nay, it finds a
thouſand things to ruin and deſtroy it. This is the reaſon, why it treats
the <hi>Scriptures</hi> as an Enemy, whoſe Aſſaults it every where meets,
and every where feels its blows.</p>
               <p>But, 'twill be objected, Are we not obliged, to anſwer the
<hi>Heriticks,</hi> who abuſe the Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> againſt the
Truth? Muſt we not, on ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, diſtinguiſh and explain the
Rule? To this I reply, that we are obliged to anſwer. But we are not
conſtrain'd to be always on the <hi>defenſive.</hi> For one Blow given by
<hi>Hereticks,</hi> which we are obliged to ward off; they are obliged to ward
off a hundred. But <hi>Popery,</hi> is not able to ſtrike one conſiderable
Blow; it is ever on the defenſive. Again, when we defend our ſelves, either
againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> or other <hi>Hereſies,</hi> we do it with
<hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelf. This Rule of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> which
furniſheth us with Weapons againſt <hi>Hereſy,</hi> does alſo furniſh
us with a <hi>Shield,</hi> againſt the Weapons uſed by Hereſy. Whereas
<hi>Popery</hi> ſeeks its <hi>defenſive Arms,</hi> in Diſtinctions,
forged in the Countrey of <hi>Tradition,</hi> and in the region of
Darkneſs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> will not omit here, to bring againſt
us, their expreſs Text, <hi>This is my body,</hi> and will tell us, that, at
leaſt in this Poynt, we muſt be on the defenſive. But I anſwer; that
ſuppoſing, in this poynt, they thould have the Text on their ſide; yet a
ſingle paſſage bears no proportion to a hundred. Again, I reply, that
this text is far from expreſly aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> at the moſt, it can only favour a <hi>real
Preſence;</hi> but determines not the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, how the <hi>bread</hi> is the
<hi>Body</hi> of Chriſt. Who <pb n="49" facs="tcp:94715:36"/>denyes that the bread is the
body of Jeſus Chriſt? Do'nt we grant it, with all Chriſtians? But is
there the leaſt hint in theſe words, that it becomes ſo, rather by way of
<hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> than by way of <hi>Conſubſtantiation,</hi>
or <hi>Impanation,</hi> or <hi>Myſtical</hi> and <hi>Spiritual
Communication?</hi>

                  <note place="margin">The modern Methods uſed by the French

the two former; and that the new Method of the Gentlemen <hi>Reconcilers,</hi>

be attentively conſidered. This Method conſiſts not, in ſhewing the

               <p>Both theſe Methods do equally diſcover, that which we are

thing that was made, was life in him;</hi> whereas no ſuch words are to be
found; for the Evangeliſt only ſaith, <hi>without him was not any thing
made, that was made.</hi> But if the Text did ſpeak as he pretends, every one
perceives, how much it is to the purpoſe, to prove <hi>Invocation of
Saints.</hi> To prove, that Saints are our Mediators, they cite theſe words
of the 7 <hi>chap. of the Epiſtle to the Hebrews, he is able to ſave to the

God ſaith to the Prophet, <hi>I have ſet thee over the Kingdoms, to root

                  <note place="margin">Blaſphemous applications of the
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note>Beſide thoſe blaſphemous and curſed Applications
which are every where ſcatter'd in their Writings; the lying Spirit, hath
taken care, to compile a whole body of them, in two <hi>Books,</hi> the one is
call'd, <hi>The Ladies Pſalter,</hi> compoſed by <hi>Bonaventure;</hi> the
other, the <hi>Bible</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> by <hi>Albertus Magnus.</hi> In
theſe two Books you will find, all the great, and glorious things, which the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> ſpeak to the Creators Glory; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the Glory of the
Creature. 'Tis <hi>not the glory of God,</hi> which the Heavens declare, 'tis
that of the <hi>Virgin; The Heavens declare your Glory, O Virgin.</hi> The 27
<hi>Pſal.</hi> celebrates God, as the <hi>Light</hi> of Believers; but 'tis
no longer He, the <hi>Virgin</hi> hath his room; <hi>O our Lady</hi> (ſay
they to her) <hi>my Illumination comes from your face.</hi> The 31
<hi>Pſal.</hi> maketh God the object of the Soul's Confidence; but they
addreſs thoſe excellent words unto the <hi>Virgin,</hi> and ſay to her;
<hi>Mother of God, I have truſted in you. I shall not be confounded for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
take my Soul into your Favour and Mercy; I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my Soul, into your hands, O
incomparable Virgin.</hi> Nothing is more peculiar to God, than the exerciſe
of <hi>Mercy,</hi> which the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> implores in the 51 <hi>Pſ.
Have mercy upon me, O God, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Papiſts</hi> pull God out of
the Throne of grace, and teach their Penitents to ſay, <hi>Have mercy upon me
O our Lady, who art call'd the Mother of Mercy; and according to the bowels of
your Compaſſions, purge me from mine Iniquities, pour out your Grace upon
me, and take not your ordinary Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency away from me: For I will confeſs my
Sins before <pb n="55" facs="tcp:94715:39"/>you; I will accuſe my ſelf of my own
faults.</hi> The <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> are peculiarly
conſecrated to the Glory of God, this is the reaſon why the
<hi>Pſalmist,</hi> every where ſings the praiſes of God, and celebrates
his Greatneſs; but all this is applyed to <hi>Mary.</hi> For inſtance, that
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent 103 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which begins, <hi>Bleſs the Lord O my
Soul;</hi> is thus changed <hi>My ſoul bleſs the Mother of Jeſus
Chriſt, and all that is within me glorify her Holy Name: Forget not Her
Benefits, Her Favours, and Her Conſolations: by Her Grace, ſins are
forgiven; by Her Mercy, Diſeaſes are healed.</hi> There is the ſame
ſtrain from the beginning to the end of the <hi>Pſalter.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Bible of Mary,</hi> is written on the very ſame
deſign. Whereas the true diſciples of <hi>J. Chriſt,</hi> find
<hi>him</hi> every where in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> (not only in the
Predictions, and Types, but even in ſuch paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, where few would have
ſought him;) This <hi>Bible</hi> of <hi>Mary</hi> finds the <hi>B.
Virgin</hi> every where in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> agreeably to its
deſign, which is, (as the Author tells us) to apply unto the moſt Holy
<hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> the Mother of God, almoſt every thing, which is in the
<hi>H. Bible.</hi> In proſecuting this deſign, the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi>
muſt be found in the firſt word of the <hi>Bible.</hi> By the
<hi>Heavens,</hi> which God created in the beginning, <hi>we muſt
underſtand, the Empyreal Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, i. e. the Lady of the World, the V.
Mary.</hi> When God ſaid, <hi>Let there be Light;</hi> the meaning is,
<hi>Let Mary be begotten and born.</hi> Every thing that is Great, and Singular
in the Antient Hiſtory, is <hi>Mary.</hi> She is the <hi>Altar,</hi> which
<hi>Noah</hi> built to God, after the Deluge: <hi>the Holocauſt, in which God
will ſmell a ſweet ſavour, is the Prayers of the ſame Virgin: the
Virgin is the Bow in the heavens, of which 'tis ſaid, when I bring a cloud
over the Earth, the bow shall be ſeen.</hi> She is the myſtical
<hi>Ladder,</hi> which <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw in a Dream; <hi>for by her, the Son
of God deſcends to us. <pb n="56" facs="tcp:94715:40"/>and by her, we aſcend to him;
she is the Gate, thro which we enter into the Kingdom of God: 'twas of the
Virgin, that</hi> Jacob <hi>ſpoke, when he ſaid, how dreadful is this
place, 'tis the Houſe of God, the Gate of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The</hi> Jewiſh
<hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and all its parts, did reſpect the Virgin. <hi>She is
the Ark of the Covenant, that is gone into Heaven before us to prepare us a
place there. She is the Mercy-ſeat of pure Gold, becauſe she was
ſanctifyed above others, in her Mothers womb.</hi> She is alſo the Altar of
Burnt-offerings; <hi>becauſe she is the Reconciler, and hath taken this
Office at her going into Heaven.</hi> We may judge of the whole piece, by
theſe ſmall ſhreds.</p>
               <p>A thouſand, and a thouſand Copies, have been taken from
theſe two famous Originals; the antient Preachers of the <hi>Roman
Church,</hi> adorned their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes with theſe excellent
<hi>flowers.</hi> For example in <hi>Solomons Song,</hi> they found a large
field for theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane applications. There the H. Spirit, in a
myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manner, ſets forth, the Wonders of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion between J.
Chriſt, and his Church, by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems, of a <hi>Bridegoom,</hi> and a
<hi>Spouſe,</hi> Theſe profane wretches apply all this to the
<hi>Virgin,</hi> as if the Myſteries of our Redemption, and Union with J.
Chriſt, were verifyed, and fulfill'd in her. And to give greater authority,
to all theſe ſhameleſs applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they were brought even into the
<hi>Hymnes</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> In them they ſay to the Virgin,
<hi>Tu quoe furentem Leviathan, ſerpentem, tortuoſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, &amp;c. Thou
bruiſeſt under thy feet the furious Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan, and the crooked
Serpent:</hi> an Elogy which the Oracle in <hi>Geneſis</hi> gives to the
Bleſſed Seed, <hi>i. e.</hi> to <hi>J. Chriſt.</hi> Another hymn ſpeaks
thus to her, <hi>Scala Jacob, ora pro nobis; Jacobs Ladder, pray for us.</hi>
Nor is leſs done to the other <hi>Saints;</hi> every one of 'em, hath his
proper Votaries; eſpecially the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <pb n="57" facs="tcp:94715:40"/>Saints,</hi>
are much more feaſted and careſſed than the <hi>old.</hi> The book of
<hi>the Conformities between S. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, and J. Chriſt,</hi> is full of
theſe Abominations. That Author will have, that God had his eye on <hi>S.
Francis,</hi> when he Created the firſt man. For to him, thoſe words ought
to be applyed, <hi>Let us make man in our Image after our Likeneſs, and let
them have dominion over the Fish of the Sea and over the Fowl, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are none, who have been ſo extravagant in abuſing the
<hi>H. Scripture,</hi> as the <hi>Preachers</hi> of the <hi>Papacy.</hi> For
they have adopted all theſe profanations, and over and above, have peculiar
ones of their own. 'Twas their profeſſion, to make the Scripture
ridiculous, and abſurd, by impertinent Expoſitions, by expreſſions fit
for the <hi>Stage,</hi> and by the language of a <hi>Farce,</hi> which they
ſtill uſed in all their diſcourſes. If any ſhould dare to deny this,
we have at this day enough to convince the incredulous, in the Sermons of
<hi>Menot,</hi> of <hi>Maillard,</hi> of <hi>Barelette,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">V. Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> from which we have made conſiderable
citations; and the conſulting them, will be uſeful to let us ſee the
Character of <hi>Popery.</hi> Tho their <hi>Preachers</hi> are not ſo
ſottiſhly extravagant in this age, yet 'tis certain, that the ſame
Character is to be diſcern'd in thoſe who are newly come out of the
<hi>Convent,</hi> and have not convers'd with the world.</p>
               <p>The Writers of <hi>Controverſy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Scripture abuſed, by Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſial writers.</note> ought to
be much more exact, and circumſpect, in the uſing of the H. Scripture.
<hi>Preachers,</hi> and thoſe who write Books of Devotion, have ſome
Priviledge in this matter, and may take ſome liberty in their Applications of
Scripture; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that theſe applications are ſutable to bring the
ſoul unto God. But when we alledge <hi>Scripture,</hi> as an evidence, to
decide a Controverſy, we muſt keep cloſe to the true Intent of the H.
Spirit; Nevertheleſs, one would pity, and bluſh for the Controverſial
wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <pb n="58" facs="tcp:94715:41"/>of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> who boldly abuſe
and wreſt the <hi>Scripture,</hi> to prove their Doctrines. We have ground
already to ſay, that all the proofs, ſhe brings from Scripture, are real
Abuſes of it. And what we have diſcourſed above, to prove that the
<hi>Papacy</hi> is not in the leaſt ſollicitous to have a conformity to the
Rule of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> might be repeated here: But beſides thoſe
abuſes, which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are forced to employ (otherwiſe they
muſt in plain terms grant that the Scripture is not their Friend, beſides
thoſe, I ſay, we may find others, which they could have ſpared.</p>

<hi>What is it to vomit up ſins, as a ſick stomach doth? We muſt follow

They have good ſtore of Scripture; for with their Method, there is nothing
which they do not quickly and eaſily find there. But if this Method of theirs

employ againſt enemies, Offenſive, and Defenſive Weapons, they ſtrike

1. That they are not neceſſary to the Church. 2. That they are
<hi>obſcure.</hi> 3. That they are <hi>defective.</hi> 4. That they have no
Authority, as to us, without the Church; there is no Method imaginable, which
they employ not, to diſhonour them. They tell us, that they were writ only
Occaſionally, and not at all with any deſign to make them a <hi>Rule</hi>
of <hi>Faith.</hi> An Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, or an Apoſtle, wrote a
<hi>Goſpel,</hi> or an <hi>Epiſtle</hi> at random, by chance, and on
particular private deſigns. Afterward the <hi>Church</hi> collected thoſe
looſe writings into one Book. But ſeeing theſe were not writ by
<hi>one</hi> or ſeveral perſons, writing in concert, we cannot find in them
a <hi>Syſtem</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Can any thing be ſaid, more affronting to the H. Spirit, who
ordered the pens of theſe Writers, and the occaſions that obliged them to
write? The <hi>Papiſts</hi> talk juſt as if the Apoſtles had writ meerly
on their own deſigns, without any <hi>Inſpiration.</hi> But did not the H.
Spirit, who moved them to write, deſign their writings collected together
ſhould be the true Rule of Faith?</p>
               <p>To leſſen the Credit of the <hi>Canonical books,</hi> that
are truly divine, <hi>Popery</hi> hath joyn'd with them <hi>fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
books;</hi> a tale of <hi>Tobit,</hi> a Romance of <hi>Judith,</hi> of
<hi>Bel</hi> and the <hi>Dragon,</hi> of <hi>Suſanna.</hi> This tends to

               <p>This is not yet enough: the more effectually to aboliſh the
holy <hi>Books,</hi> and their Authority, they affirm, that at this time, we
have not the <hi>H. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> compleat. Many Books (ſay they) are
loſt; we have not the Book of the <hi>Wars of the Lord,</hi> mention'd in the
Book of <hi>Numbers.</hi> We have not the Books of <hi>Gad,</hi> and of
<hi>Iddo. Solomon</hi> wrote concerning plants, from the Cedar, even to the
Hyſſop, and I know not how many thouſand Parables, and Songs, which we
have not. <hi>S. Paul</hi> wrote <hi>a third Epiſtle to the

<hi>Laodicea,</hi> and perhaps many others, which are not to be found; and who
knows whether in all theſe writings that we have not, there were not
innumerable things, which would have made the Rule of Faith more compleat.
Perhaps, what is come down to us, are only ſome Planks eſcap'd from a
Shipwrack, which hath ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the Veſſel. All the ſacred

               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> to compleat the Affront, they pull away

               <p>At preſent I appeal to the Conſciences of all the men in the

without digreſſing, or going far; we need but conſider the bold attempts
of the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Clergy</hi> to diſpenſe with the law of
God, and act contrary to it: no greater violence or affront can be offer'd to
any Law, than to command what it forbids, and forbid what is commanded by it.
This is the caſe with the <hi>Church of Rome. Popery</hi> requires the making
of <hi>Images,</hi> and injoyns the worſhip of 'em; the Law of
<hi>Chriſtianity</hi> forbids it. <hi>Popery</hi> forbids the eating of all
ſorts of <hi>meat,</hi> at all times, and forbids the marriage of the
<hi>Clergy;</hi> both are allowed by the Great Law of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi>
It grants <hi>diſpenſations</hi> contrary to the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New
Teſtament,</hi> it diſpenſeth with the obſervation of the moſt
ſolemn vows made to God, and with Oaths of fidelity made to Kings, wherein
the name of God is invok't. It diſpenſeth with that ſacred and
inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble commandment of childrens obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and
permits <hi>girles</hi> of twelve or fifteen years old to caſt off the
Paternal yoke that they may enter into <pb n="69" facs="tcp:94715:46"/>a <hi>Nunnery.</hi>
It authorizeth the revolt and rebellion of <hi>Children</hi> againſt their
own <hi>Fathers,</hi> even ſo far as to permit them to uſurp their
<hi>Crowns,</hi> and overturn their Thrones, as is evident in Hiſtory. It
eſtabliſheth new <hi>Sanctuaries</hi> and places of refuge in their
<hi>Churches</hi> to ſave the lives of <hi>Murderers,</hi> contrary to the
expreſs command of God. It makes void the plaineſt precept of God, that
<hi>every Soul muſt be ſubject to the Higher Powers,</hi> by the many
immunities granted to their <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiasticks,</hi> exempting them from the
<hi>ſecular</hi> power. It allows <hi>Fornication</hi> and <hi>Sodomy</hi>
for ſuch a ſum of money, and permits <hi>Incest,</hi> contrary to the Law
of God. It gives a Woman leave to marry two Brothers, or a man to marry two
Siſters, or an unckle to marry his Neice. It diſpenſeth contrary to the
Apoſtles Rule, that <hi>a Bishop should not be a Child or a Novice,</hi> for
it beſtows <hi>benefices</hi> and <hi>Bishopsricks</hi> upon ſuch as are
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unfit and incapable; which agrees exactly with what was foretold

               <p>Theſe <hi>Seducers</hi> will doubtleſs tell their <hi>new

the <hi>Pope</hi> is not ſuperior to the <hi>Laws,</hi> and cannot
diſpenſe with the <hi>Canons.</hi> This is the doctrine of the

written by <hi>Favoriti</hi> againſt the plea of the <hi>Procureur
General,</hi> concerning the affair of <hi>Charonne.</hi> He hath preſt the
matter home in that point, and made it evident, that they themſelves do
acknowledg and grant this Authority in the <hi>Pope,</hi> to diſpenſe
contrary to the Canons of the <hi>Church,</hi> and even contrary to the laws of
God: becauſe in <hi>France</hi> all the Benefices they injoy in

<hi>Rome</hi> from the time where we ſix <hi>the Riſe of Antichriſt.</hi>
We place it about the middle of the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Century;</hi> ſince that time
it will be ſaid, there have been ſome good <hi>Popes.</hi> It will not be
very eaſy to find any conſiderable number of <pb n="73" facs="tcp:94715:48"/>'em; but
ſuppoſing that there have been ſome good ones, we ſay, that
<hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> is not a Monſter, that is born all in one day.
<hi>It is,</hi> to ſpeak properly, <hi>that Corruption of
Chriſtianity:</hi> now all ſorts of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions do advance by degrees. The
<hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity</hi> did gradually abandon the
<hi>Popes,</hi> as they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook the Truth, and roſe to Tyranny: as long as
they preſerved any thing of the purity of worſhip, God did not permit his
H. Spirit abſolutely to leave 'em. But when <hi>Idolatry</hi> came to its
height, when the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination was ſet up in the Sanctuary, which came to
paſs when <hi>Images</hi> prevail'd, then the Spirit of the Devil took
poſſeſſion of that <hi>Chair,</hi> and we hardly meet with any ſince,
but diſſolute Monſters, or meer worldlings.</p>
               <p>My <hi>ſecond</hi> Reflections is this, that to manifeſt,
that ſince the perfect eſtabliſhment of <hi>Popery,</hi> the
<hi>Popes</hi> have entirely loſt the Spirit of J. Chriſt, and of the
Goſpel; 'tis no way neceſſary to prove a continued ſucceſſion of
ſuch profligate <hi>Popes,</hi> without any interruption. You muſt know,
that a fair appearance of Honeſty, and what among Great Men is called the
Wiſdom of the World, is oftentimes as oppoſite to the Spirit of Jeſus
Chriſt, as the moſt publick Crimes. If in the hiſtory of the <hi>See</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> they can find one <hi>Pope</hi> that was but indifferently
honeſt, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> preſently frame an Exception from it

                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:94715:49"/>and hath declar'd againſt them, but
loves <hi>Money</hi> exceedingly. We know from very good hands, that he is a
Monſter of <hi>Covetouſneſs;</hi> and the modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Expences is
owing to that vice. He is the principal <hi>Merchant</hi> of the <hi>Corn</hi>
of <hi>Europe:</hi> He obliges all his ſubjects to fell their <hi>Corn</hi>
to the <hi>Apoſtolic Chamber:</hi> and when he is Maſter of it at a very
low rate, he ſells it again to the people for double the price which he gave
'em: 'tis it may be the moſt deteſtable Inſtance of <hi>Monopoly</hi>

Is it ſuch a buſineſs to be gloried in? 'Tis a mighty wonder indeed!

of Antichriſtianiſm: an Epitome of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders and Corruptions of the
<hi>Popes</hi> from the ninth Century unto the ſeventeenth.</head>
               <p>WE may begin this <hi>Hiſtory</hi> from the <hi>eighth</hi>
and <hi>ninth</hi> Century, when the Controverſy aroſe and was continued
between the Worſhippers of <hi>Images,</hi> and the oppoſers of 'em. The
<hi>Popes</hi> were very zealous <hi>Image-worshippers,</hi> and maintain'd
that Quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Eaſtern Emperors,</hi> and cauſ'd thoſe
dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Commotions, wherwith the <hi>Church</hi> was torn for above an
hundred <hi>years.</hi> Their <hi>Character</hi> in thoſe times was, not only
of men ſottiſhly Ignorant, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and Idolatrous, but fierce
and head ſtrong, raging and violent to that degree, as to rebel againſt
their lawfull <hi>Emperors,</hi> and excite the people of <hi>Italy</hi> to a
Revolt. We may find, I ſay, even from thoſe times, that the Wickedneſs of
the <hi>Popes</hi> was advanc't to that degree, as did manifeſt their
<hi>Antichriſtianiſm.</hi> But I'm content to be ſo kind to 'em as to
leave them there, becauſe it ſeems to me to be a ſufficient proof that
that <hi>Seat</hi> is the Seat of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> that we find there a
conſtant Succeſſion of <hi>Villains</hi> and <hi>Worldlings</hi> for the
ſpace of ſeven or eight hundred <hi>years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Corruption of <hi>divine worship</hi> being got to its
height about the end of the <hi>ninth</hi> Century, God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the
<hi>corruption of manners</hi> to be moſt extreme in the following Century,
and then was accompliſht the Prophecy of the <hi>firſt Vial,</hi> and the
<hi>firſt Plague;</hi> a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Ulcer, noiſome and hideous overſpread
thoſe who bore the mark of the Beaſt, thoſe eſpecially who 
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94715:50"/>ſat upon his Throne. The H. Spirit decyphering therby the
proper period of this Corruption, 'tis from the <hi>tenth</hi> Century we
muſt begin the Hiſtory of the Abominations of the <hi>Popes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Formoſus</hi> dyed in the year 897. by means of a
faction of villains his ſeat was filled by one called
<hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An. 897. The Popes of the 10. Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,
and their Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</note> who had twice before been depoſed, once while a
Deacon, and a ſecond time when he was Prieſt. This <hi>Boniface</hi> turn'd
out of the chair by another Faction,<note place="margin">Platina.</note> gives
place to <hi>Stephen VII.</hi> who made himſelf very famous by a remarkable
Action, in cauſing the Body of <hi>Formoſus</hi> to be dig'd out of its
Grave, and a Proceſs to be made againſt him, upon this pretence, that he
ſuffer'd himſelf to be tranſlated from another <hi>Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> to
that of <hi>Rome,</hi> contrary to the <hi>Canons,</hi> and ſo his Body was
thrown into the <hi>Tyber.</hi> The Hiſtorians who write the lives of the
<hi>Popes,</hi> characterize him as a profligate Wretch, and make him to have
govern'd only fifteen moneths. Two <hi>Popes</hi> follow'd, whereof the one
ſat in that <hi>chair</hi> but four moneths, and the other no more than three
weeks. After this came <hi>John</hi> 9. who continued three years ſay
ſome,<note place="margin">An. 906.</note> others make it but one year and
ſome moneths. One <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi> ſucceeded him on the one hand,
whilſt a vile fellow, named <hi>Sergius</hi> on the other did alſo
exerciſe the <hi>Pontificial</hi> Power. As appears by the records of thoſe
times. <hi>Leo V.</hi> followed upon the death of <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,</hi> who at
the end of forty days was impriſon'd by another <hi>Pope,</hi> named
<hi>Chriſtopholus,</hi> who had the Chair but ſeven moneths. Here are at
leaſt ſeven or eight <hi>Popes</hi> in that number of years, becauſe they
turn'd out and ſtrangled one another. An excellent Character and
deſcription of the <hi>Succeſſors</hi> of our B. Lord.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Chriſtopholus</hi> was turn'd out by another
Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,<note place="margin">An. 908.</note> named <hi>Sergius,</hi> of the
Faction of the Marquiſs of <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> Here we ought to peruſe the

                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:94715:50"/>himſelf, who enters
upon the <hi>tenth Century,</hi> with Rage and Paſſion, calling it the
<hi>Leaden,</hi> the <hi>Iron Age,</hi> a <hi>Century of Horror and
Darkneſs.</hi> At this time ruled thoſe two Notorious Strumpets,
<hi>Theodora</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Dame, moſt infamous for her lewdneſs,
and her Daughter <hi>Maroſia</hi> wife to <hi>Albertus</hi> the Marqueſs of
<hi>Hetruria,</hi> and Concubine of this Pope <hi>Sergius,</hi> who at the
ſame time kept the Mother and the Daughter, to reward them for raiſing him
to be <hi>Pope</hi> by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and Authority. One
<hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſucceeded him, concerning whom we have no account: it
is not eaſy to imagine the cauſe, for as this <hi>Pope</hi> was one of the
Cabal of <hi>Theodora</hi> and <hi>Maroſia,</hi> he was of the like character
with his Predeceſſors. After him comes <hi>Laudo,</hi> who to oblige the
infamous <hi>Theodora</hi> prefer'd a Prieſt of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> named
<hi>John,</hi> to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Bologna,</hi> and afterwards to be
Archbiſhop of <hi>Ravenna.</hi> But <hi>Theodora</hi> not finding it for her
Convenience to have her Gallant at ſuch a diſtance from her, quickly makes
away with <hi>Laudo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An. 912.</note> and makes this
<hi>John the tenth,</hi> by name, Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Platina.</note> Some Hiſtorians ſay, that This <hi>John</hi>
was the ſon of Pope <hi>Sergius</hi> by <hi>Maroſia, Theodora's</hi>
daughter. This <hi>Pope</hi> then was the Son of a <hi>Pope,</hi> and kept his
grand-mother <hi>Theodora</hi> to be his whore. This Monſter poſſeſs'd
the <hi>Chair</hi> ſixteen years, and leſt it by a violent death; for
<hi>Maroſia,</hi> who is reputed by ſome Authors to have been his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
cauſed him to be put in priſon, and there to be ſtifled under a Bed. She
made <hi>Leo VI.</hi> Pope in his room, who ſurviv'd but ſix months, and
dyed in priſon, of a violent Death as his Predeceſſor did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stephen VIII.</hi> ſucceeded him, and he was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to
continue in the <hi>chair</hi> till it was thought fit to place <hi>John</hi>
11. in his room, who according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſeveral Authors was
<hi>Maroſia's</hi> baſtard by Pope <hi>Sergius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An.

<hi>Maroſia</hi> for his whore. <hi>Albertus</hi> the ſon of
<hi>Maroſia</hi> by her marriage with <hi>Albertus</hi> Marqueſs of

                  <note place="margin">An.

latter dyes there, and leaves his ſeat to <hi>Leo VIII.</hi> of whom
<hi>Platina</hi> gives this great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, <hi>nihil memoriâ dignum

he offer'd incenſe to the Devil, and invok't <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and the other
Gods of <hi>Paganiſm:</hi> the Emperor <hi>Otho</hi> coming to <hi>Rome,</hi>
cauſed this monſter to be depos'd, but he formed a party againſt the
Emperor, by which an Inſurrection was made, and much Blood ſhed.
<hi>Otho</hi> remain'd Maſter, and ſet up another <hi>Pope;</hi> but

whither he carried all the moveables, and as much of the treaſure of <hi>St.

<hi>Rome,</hi> and puts himſelf again in the <hi>Chair,</hi> where he found
one named <hi>John XIV.</hi> whom he throwes into Priſon, and there he is
ſtarv'd to death. Eight moneths after this, he himſelf dyes, and is drag'd

Furies, whoſe Debaucheries are hardly taken notice of, becauſe their
Ambition and Pride tranſported them to that degree, as made their other Vices

                  <hi>Alexander II.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An. 1061.</note> was

his conſent, cauſed another to be choſen at <hi>Baſil,</hi> named
<hi>Cadalous,</hi> and ſent him to <hi>Rome</hi> with the name of
<hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius II. Italy</hi> is hereupon divided, and Armies raiſed for the
one and for the other, there were pitcht Battells, and Sieges, and very much
blood ſhed. At length <hi>Alexander</hi> gets the victory, and remains
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: <hi>Honorius</hi> after having endur'd a Siege of two years in the
Caſtle of <hi>S. Angelo,</hi> forſaken of all his Friends, he dyes of
deſpair. See how they diſputed for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Heritage of
Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>From that time the <hi>Popes</hi> began to diſtinguiſh

<hi>Authority</hi> of the Emperors. <hi>Alexander II.</hi> undertook to cite
the Emperor <hi>Henry IV.</hi> before him, <pb n="83" facs="tcp:94715:53"/>to purge
himſelf from the Crimes that were laid to his charge. But <hi>Hildebrand</hi>
the Monk of <hi>Clugny,</hi> that Monſter of Pride, when he was made
<hi>Pope</hi> under the name of <hi>Gregory VII.</hi> carried his Inſolence
againſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns much farther than any of his Predeceſſors had done.
He began his <hi>Pontificat</hi> with a falſe Oath, for having ſworn
fidelity to the Emperor <hi>Henry IV.</hi> he revolts from him, to become his
Maſter. He Cites him, Excommunicates him, Depoſeth him, and puts
<hi>Rodolphus</hi> of <hi>Senobia</hi> in his place. That wretched
<hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus</hi> ſuffers the due Puniſhment of the Crimes which the
<hi>Pope</hi> had made him commit. He is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and dyes, and makes this
excellent declaration at his death; <hi>Behold I now leave the
Empire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Abbas Uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergenſis.</note> 
                  <hi>and this
preſent life; ſee this perfidious hand, which I lified up to Heaven, when I
ſwore Fidelity to my Empeur: Behold me in this deplorable condition, you that
made me uſurp that Throne which belong'd to him. Gregory</hi> makes the
Emperor <hi>Henry IV.</hi> come to him a foot to obtain his peace, makes him
wait three days barefoot in the Snow at the Gate of his Caſtle, ſtrips him
of his Imperial Habits, and makes him put out a pitifull woollen cloak, and
ſhews him a Whip and a pair of Sciſſors, to let him know that he
deſerved to have his head ſhav'd,<note place="margin">Malmsbuty.</note> and
be thruſt into a Convent, and there to have ſevere Diſcipline. He added
Perfidiouſneſs to his Pride, and wrote to the <hi>Germans,</hi> that he had
given the <hi>Emperor</hi> Peace, but not reſtor'd to him his
<hi>Empire.</hi> This Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant did likewiſe excommunicate and depoſe the
<hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> and of <hi>Poland,</hi> the <hi>Emperor</hi>
of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and threatned as much to <hi>Philip I.</hi> of
<hi>France.</hi> His Pride exceeded that of any of his Predeceſſors, but he
had not renounc't their Vices. He was ſuſpected to have been too familiar
with <hi>Mathilde.</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> he oblig'd her to
part from her husband, that he might the more eaſily enjoy her, and ſo
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted <pb n="84" facs="tcp:94715:54"/>her, that ſhe bequeath'd all the lands ſhe
had in <hi>Italy,</hi> which were very conſiderable, unto the
<hi>Church:</hi> beſides this, <hi>Benno</hi> accuſeth him to have been a
<hi>Sorcerer</hi> and <hi>Necromancer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The conduct of this <hi>Gregory</hi> was a pattern for all his
Succeſſors, who copied it exactly. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban II.</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues the
revolt, and engages in it <hi>Conrad</hi> the Emperor <hi>Henry's</hi> own
ſon. This Son drove his own Father out of <hi>Italy,</hi> but dyed ſoon
after without enjoying the fruits of his Crime. <hi>Paſcal II.</hi> engages
<hi>Henry</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors ſecond Son in the ſame Rebellion againſt his
Father, and ſtirs him up to that degree of inhumanity, as to deprive his
Father of every thing, and even to take him out of his Grave after his death.
The <hi>Popes</hi> forced the Emperor <hi>Henry IV.</hi> to fight above
three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Battells: and in that manner they prodigally ſhed the beſt
Blood of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy. Paſcal II.</hi> made a Treaty of
peace with the Emperor <hi>Henry V.</hi> and confirm'd it by the moſt
dreadful Oaths, breaking a conſecrated <hi>wafer</hi> (their breaden God) in

<hi>John Maria de Monte</hi> was choſen <hi>Pope,</hi> by the name of
<hi>Julius III.</hi> the moſt Voluptuous Man in the World. He was
ſuſpected of <hi>Sodomy</hi> with a ſtrange young Boy call'd
<hi>Innocent,</hi> whom he made a <hi>Cardinal.</hi> But Sodomy in a

                  <hi>Paul IV.</hi> was the proudeſt Creature in the world; He
would ſtamp with his <hi>Foot,</hi> and ſay, I'le bring down all the
<hi>Kings</hi> under this <hi>Foot.</hi> He fill'd all <hi>Italie</hi> with
Commotions, and made himſelf ſo odious to the people, that no ſooner was
his Breath gone, but his <hi>Statues</hi> were pull'd down, and thrown into the
<hi>Sewers. Pius IV.</hi> who finiſht the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> was
<hi>Wiſe</hi> as to the World, one of the moſt cunning Politicians of that
Age: His Policy was tryed to purpoſe, with the difficulties he met with in
managing that <hi>Councill,</hi> in order to the keeping up his Soveraignty,
and hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it from doing any dammage to the <hi>Court of Rome. Pius V.</hi>
was a cruel Perſecutor of the Truth. <hi>Gregory <pb n="91" facs="tcp:94715:57"/>XIII.</hi> approved of the <hi>Maſſacre</hi> at <hi>Paris;</hi> he
orderd that Tokens of publick Joy ſhould be made at <hi>Rome</hi> for it: And

performed in his <hi>Reign,</hi> he coyn'd a <hi>Medal,</hi> on one ſide was
<hi>himſelf,</hi> on the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,</hi> a repreſentation of the
<hi>Maſſacre,</hi> with theſe words, <hi>Hugonotorum ſtrages; the
ſlaughter of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots.</hi> This <hi>Maſſacre,</hi> was an
abominable Fact; and whoever approves of it, muſt either be
<hi>Antichriſt,</hi> or the <hi>Son</hi> of Antichriſt. <hi>Sixtus V.</hi>
who ſucceeded, was the Patron of the <hi>League,</hi> he ſet all
<hi>France</hi> in a flame. This proved, that he muſt have been a very good
friend of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> And yet they have told the World, that he was
a <hi>Conjurer,</hi> and made a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact with the Devil to make himſelf
<hi>Pope. Clement VIII.</hi> was accuſed to be a Poyſoner, a Murtherer,
guilty of Simony, a Sodomite, a Perjured Villain, an Adulterer, guilty of
Superſtitious divinations, and ſacriledge. Thus ended the <hi>laſt
Age.</hi> As for the <hi>Popes</hi> of our <hi>Age,</hi> they are well enough
known. We know, that <hi>Rome,</hi> is always <hi>Rome.</hi> We need only read
the Writings of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves, ſuch as the life of
<hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> the Miſs of <hi>Innocent X.</hi> the Syndicat of
<hi>Alexander VII.</hi> and a hundred other pieces of this nature; which are
call'd <hi>Libels,</hi> and <hi>Satyrs,</hi> but do inform us of many
Truths.</p>
               <p>All this, is the leaſt part, of what might be ſayd on this
head. 'Tis an <hi>Ocean</hi> of Iniquities which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be drawn dry. In a
word, we muſt know, there hath not been a Throne in the World, defiled with
ſuch Abominations. We find above 25 <hi>Popes,</hi> convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, or accuſed
of <hi>Magick.</hi> Cardinal <hi>Benno</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons up ſeveral in leſs
than fifty <hi>years.</hi> He was a <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi> of the <hi>Roman
Church,</hi> in the time of <hi>Gregory VII.</hi> Tis true, he was a bitter
enemy of that <hi>Pope,</hi> and conſequently, it may perhaps be ſaid, that
he is <pb n="92" facs="tcp:94715:58"/>immoderate, in ſpeaking of him. But I would fain
know, what Intereſt he could have in painting out in ſuch a manner, the
<hi>ſeven Popes,</hi> that were Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors of <hi>Gregory VII?</hi>
What rage, could induce him, to diſhonour a <hi>Church</hi> in which he was
<hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> and <hi>Arch-presbyter,</hi> if there had not been the
force of truth, and the wiſe Providence of God, who would furniſh us with
this <hi>Witneſs?</hi> We find in the <hi>Holy See,</hi> examples of the
moſt horrid Brutalities, that ever <hi>Paganiſm</hi> was guilty of,
<hi>Inceſts, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Sodomies, Whoring;</hi> and all along, a
mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Pride.</hi> I confeſs, I
never reflect on this, without trembling at the diſmal judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and
the blindneſs, which men may contract. When men ſhall come to themſelves,
they will wonder (as I do) how ſuch multitudes can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly look on this
ſpectacle without Horror: how they perſuade themſelves, that ſuch a
<hi>Seat,</hi> can be the Seat of <hi>J. Chriſt,</hi> the manſion of the
<hi>H. Spirit,</hi> the ſource of thoſe <hi>Oracles,</hi> that guide the
<hi>Church.</hi> Surely, ſay I, ſome Thunder-clap hath ſtruck the Hearts
of Men, and plainly brutifyed them.</p>
               <p>None muſt object, that ſome <hi>High Prieſts</hi> under
the <hi>Law,</hi> were wicked, and favourd <hi>Idolatry:</hi> for 1.
<hi>Firſt</hi> they come behind theſe Examples, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and a

of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> which the <hi>Popes</hi> pretend to. 3.
<hi>Laſtly.</hi> 'Tis not to be wondred at, that about the End of
<hi>Judaiſm,</hi> God who intended to aboliſh that <hi>Religion,</hi>
ſhould permit ſome of the laſt <hi>High-prieſts</hi> to fall into great
Wickedneſs.</p>

<hi>Roman Church</hi> at that time, we need only hear the Confeſſions,
which our Adverſaries make at this day. Read <hi>Maimbourg's</hi> Hiſtory
of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theraniſm, Mr. Arnaud's Apologie for Catholicks,</hi> and (to ſay
all in a word) all thoſe who have either writ the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>laſt Age,</hi> or have made Remarques on that
<hi>Hiſtory.</hi> They all ſay, that 'tis true, there was reaſon to
complain and be offended <pb n="99" facs="tcp:94715:61"/>at the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and
<hi>Monks;</hi> that the Corruption was deplorable, and Manners extremely
corrupted; and that, this occaſion'd the revolt of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and
<hi>Luther,</hi> and diſpoſed the ſpirits of the <hi>people</hi> to
ſeparate from a <hi>Clergy,</hi> that was guilty of ſuch diſmal
Diſorders. Beſides, we have the Confeſſions of the <hi>Papiſts</hi>
of the ſame <hi>Age,</hi> of Pope <hi>Adrian VI.</hi> of <hi>Cornelius
Muſſe,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bitonto,</hi> who in the midſt of the
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> ſaid, <hi>That there was no Filthyneſs
how monſtrous ſoever, no Villany, no Impurity, with which the People and
Clergy were not defiled.</hi> We have the Teſtimony of the famous
<hi>Mantuan,</hi> and of the learned <hi>Eſpenſaus,</hi> who make ſuch
diſmal and affrighting deſcriptions of the manners of the <hi>Roman
City</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> in general, that one cannot forbear trembling, as
he reads them. After this, we need not the teſtimony of the
<hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi> and of the <hi>Hundred Grievances,</hi> which were drawn
up at the Diet of <hi>Norimberg</hi> 1522. wherein the Abominations of the
<hi>Clergy</hi> of that time, are ſet down with exact Fidelity.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Prieſts, and Monks have always been
guilty of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>Obſerve, I pray you, that this
diſmal <hi>Corruption of Manners,</hi> in all the Ages which we have been
men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning, hath always been charged more particularly on the <hi>Clergy,</hi>
than on the <hi>People.</hi> And this is a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Character of
<hi>Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> that is found in the <hi>Papacy.</hi> We know
that the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Monks</hi> are the principal Members of the
<hi>Papacy:</hi> its Spirit and Soul reſides in them ſo, that if
<hi>Popery</hi> were <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> the ſpirit of this later, would
be found in theſe two <hi>Orders</hi> of men; we ſhould perceive ſome
marks of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion</hi> to ſhine forth in them. But by a
righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judgment, God hath permitted them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the very greateſt
corruption; to convince thoſe whom God will ſave, that the <hi>Papal
Empire</hi> cannot be the Kingdom of J. Chriſt. The Corruption of the
<hi>Prieſts, Monks,</hi> and <hi>Nuns,</hi> hath always been worſe 
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94715:62"/>than that of the <hi>Laity,</hi> that ſo it might
appear, that the farther a man goes in <hi>Popery,</hi> the more he partakes of
the ſpirit of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> We may view over again <hi>Alvares
Pelagius, Petrach, Nicholas de Clemangis, Faſciculus Temporum,</hi> and add
to them, <hi>Walter Mapes</hi> an Engliſh Doctor, <hi>Arnold de Villâ
novâ, Leonard Aretine,</hi> and an infinite number of others; and we
ſhall ſee, that their moſt bitter Invectives, the lively De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions,
and affrighting Repreſentations of the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi> they ſpeak of,
do principally relate to the <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> the <hi>Prieſts,</hi>
the <hi>Clergy,</hi> the <hi>Monks,</hi> and <hi>Nuns.</hi> This is not a
matter that needs to be proved. 'Tis notorious even in our dayes: for all, who
have had a mind to collect filthy and obſcene ſtories (even among the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves) ſcarce relate any thing, beſides the
enormous Crimes of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Monks;</hi> this hath made
the Name of a <hi>Fryar</hi> odious; and the Proverbs which are in uſe, among
the vulgar, make theſe the Inſtances of impurity: ſuch a one (they ſay)
is <hi>Lazy, fat,</hi> and <hi>leacherous</hi> as a <hi>Friar.</hi> Hence,
thoſe who write <hi>Satyrs,</hi> fall eſpecially on the <hi>Monks,</hi> as
may be ſeen in the writings of <hi>Rablais,</hi> and the <hi>Apologie for
Herodotus.</hi> Nor are they only obſcure writers, who have attacht them with
violence: The Biſhop of <hi>Bellay,</hi> in the preſent age, hath omitted
nothing, that might make them odious. And yet not one paſſage in him can be
cited, where he hath ſpoken without truth.</p>

thoſe, who have not quite loſt even Common ſenſe. How can it
poſſibly enter into the mind of any man, that the only <hi>true Church</hi>
ſhould be found in a <hi>Society,</hi> which for eight hundred <hi>years</hi>
together, hath been guilty of ſo abominable a <hi>corruption of manners,</hi>
that, that of the Heathens has not equall'd it? I grant <pb n="101" facs="tcp:94715:62"/>indeed that we may find in <hi>Heathen Hiſtory,</hi> ſome
paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, as diſmal, as thoſe which are ſeen in the Hiſtory of the
<hi>Papacy:</hi> But I am bold to ſay, that we cannot find ſuch a long
ſeries of Villanies, and abominable Practices ſo long continued. For about
a thouſand years, a <hi>Church</hi> is made up of Drunkards, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers,
Inceſtuous, Wizzards, Magicians, Sodomites, Luxurious, Unclean Wretches,
without Shame, without Virtue, without Modeſty, without Bounds, without
Maſque. Theſe are the main body, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, there are ſcarce
honeſt men enough, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Diſorders of the reſt. A man, I
ſay, muſt be reſolved to damn himſelf in cool Blood, if he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts
this Abſurdity, and is perſuaded, that 'tis poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt,</hi> to abandon his <hi>true Church</hi> at this rate, and ſuffer

this?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Vanity of the Papiſts
excuſes.</note>'Twill perhaps be reply'd, that in all <hi>Ages</hi> of the
Church, the H. <hi>Fathers</hi> have complain'd of <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
Manners;</hi> and that we muſt not condemn the whole, for the Faults of
ſome particular men. But 'tis an intolerable Affront, to the <hi>Primitive
Church,</hi> to make the Compariſon, between ſome Diſorders, that the
<hi>Fathers</hi> complain'd of, and the horrid Enormities of the
<hi>Papacy.</hi> At leaſt, the <hi>Clergy</hi> of thoſe times, complain'd;
therefore they were not guilty of the Diſorders that they reproacht in
others. Some will ſay, That there were great <hi>Corruptions</hi> ſometimes
in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which was the only people of God. 'Tis
true; but then they did not laſt ſo long; God never ſufferd this people
to perſevere conſtantly, for <hi>ſeven</hi> or <hi>eight</hi> Ages, in
the Vices of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and in the Abominations which they borrowed
from the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis ſayd, that however theſe Diſorders are
<hi>paſt,</hi> and that we cannot any longer juſtly charge the <hi>Church
of Rome</hi> with them: But <hi>Firſt,</hi> if this were true, it 
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:94715:63"/>doth not contradict the Truth of what I have alledg'd:
'Tis a certain Truth, that the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> for <hi>ſeven</hi> or
<hi>eight Ages,</hi> was ſunk into this extreme Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. And I ſay it
over again; There is none who retains any Liberty of Mind, who can poſſibly
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the <hi>true Church</hi> could lye under this diſmal Infamy
for ſo long a time, thro the permiſſion of God. But, beſides, where is
this <hi>Reformation of Manners,</hi> which they ſo much glory in? In all the
<hi>Countreys,</hi> where there are no <hi>Protestants</hi> to inſpect the
Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Manners of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> things are almoſt at the
ſame paſs. We have <hi>Hiſtorians, Travellors,</hi> and Writers of
<hi>Travells,</hi> who tell us, that in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,
Convents</hi> are places of Proſtitution, the <hi>Monks</hi> are employ'd to
execute the worſt of Villanies, and the <hi>Prieſts</hi> are the moſt
notorious Pimps. We may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult <hi>A Relation of the Commonwealth of
Venice,</hi> writ by <hi>M. de S. Didier</hi> a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and a
thouſand other <hi>Books,</hi> that are in every ones hands.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, in ſome <hi>Countries,</hi> the outſide is
ſomewhat alter'd, eſpecially in <hi>France,</hi> where for theſe twenty
years paſt, the <hi>Court</hi> being ſet upon the deſign of Reunion, hath
judg'd it neceſſary (in order to gain the <hi>Proteſtants</hi>) to oblige
the <hi>Clergy</hi> to behave themſelves with more diſcretion. But how long
hath this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued; and how far doth it reach? 'Tis in this preſent Age,
that the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Bellay,</hi> hath ſet forth the
<hi>Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> as the Receptacles of <hi>Idle Drones,</hi> who live on
the charge of the publick, and their Practice, is nothing but a company of
Tricks to procure Gifts, Legacies by Will, Alms, the Eſtates of the Poor, of
the Widows, and Orphans. 'Tis in our dayes, and within theſe 20 years, that
the Behavior of all the <hi>Convents</hi> of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliers,</hi> in all
<hi>France,</hi> hath been diſcover'd. <hi>The Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum of the Nunns of
Province,</hi> (the moſt notable piece that hath ſeen the light theſe
hundred years) hath told <pb n="103" facs="tcp:94715:63"/>us, that theſe wretches, turn
the <hi>Nunneries</hi> which are committed to them, into infamous places, to
game and Drink in, where they converſe very laſciviouſly with the
<hi>Nunns,</hi> where both words and actions are licentious, where the
higheſt Debauches are acted, where the <hi>Nunns</hi> take the <hi>Monks</hi>
into their Beds, and ſuffer themſelves to be debaucht, even at the foot of
the Altar. This, I ſay, is very lately done, yea 'tis univerſal. 'Tis not
one <hi>Convent</hi> alone, that is thus guilty; the <hi>Factum</hi> tells us,
that the very ſame is acted in all the reſt. The piece is too curious, and
too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, to be neglected. It ought to be <hi>read,</hi> that we may
there ſee, the preſent and modern Holineſs of the <hi>Papacy:</hi> the
<hi>Copies</hi> are not yet ſo rare, but they may be had, and large Citations
may be read in our <hi>Legal Exceptions</hi> againſt <hi>Popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Hiſtory of <hi>Magdelen</hi> of <hi>Bavent,</hi> a
<hi>Nun</hi> of the <hi>Convent</hi> of <hi>Louriers</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi>
is of as freſh a date. This wretched Creature, together with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of the <hi>Nunns</hi> of that <hi>Convent,</hi> acted ſuch
Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, that would make one tremble, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of two
<hi>Prieſts,</hi> who were <hi>Directors</hi> of that <hi>Houſe.</hi>
Theſe curſed monſters, were wont to ſay <hi>Maſs</hi> to the Honour
of the <hi>devil,</hi> and made uſe of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated <hi>Hosts</hi> when
they lay with the <hi>Nunns,</hi> in ſuch a manner that I dare not expreſs
it; 'tis to be read in the <hi>Proceſs;</hi> which we might ſet down whole,
if it was neceſſary. The matter was examined in the <hi>Parliament</hi> of
<hi>Rouan,</hi> the <hi>Convent</hi> was <hi>razed,</hi> the <hi>Directors</hi>
were burnt, <hi>Magdelen Bavent</hi> was impriſon'd, ſeveral of the
<hi>Nuns</hi> were ſentenc'd, and diſpers'd into obſcure places. Some
were puniſht with perpetual impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The buſineſs was huſht up
to prevent the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal. Thus when the Vail is never ſo little drawn
aſide, we diſcry Villanies, cover'd with a pretence of
<hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi> In earneſt, is a man edifyed by the Lives of 
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:94715:64"/>our <hi>Court-Bishops,</hi> by their Luxury, their
Prodigality, the Coſtlineſs of their Furniture, of their Tables, and
Equipages, by their irregular, licentious Lives, nay ſcandalous as to women?
Is not every <hi>Satyr</hi> fill'd with their Diſorders, and Debauches? Shall
they perſuade us, that the <hi>Court of Rome</hi> is reformed? Thoſe who
are dayly Witneſſes of what is done there, do they not give ſuch
deſcriptions of it, as are almoſt the ſame, with thoſe we read in old
Writers? I conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the
<hi>Manners</hi> of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> we meet with an exact Accompliſhment
of what was foretold concerning the deſperate <hi>Corruption</hi> of the

proud conceit in men, that they are ſaved by their own Merit; that their
Perſeverance depends on themſelves; that they are able to do more good
works, than they are obliged to do; that the overplus makes ſatisfaction for
thoſe who have not enough of their own. A few diſciples of S. Auguſtine

That <hi>Kings</hi> are only the <hi>doggs of his flock:</hi> but the

are their Gods, for they canonize'em, and decree them to have the honour of

ſo. They give <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences</hi> for <hi>Sodomy,</hi> and

arrogantly aſcribe to himſelf a ſoveraign Power, which doth no way belong

<hi>Emperors</hi> and depoſe <hi>Kings,</hi> and cauſe ſo many
thouſands to be <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd</hi> to preſerve himſelf in this authority,

tyrannick Power we have been ſpeaking of? Is it the leſs true, that he hath

would this make any alteration in the <hi>Kings</hi> Right, if he have any?
would he not ſtill have reaſon on his ſide, if it be true that he is in

contracted by another Potentate, in words and writing, if the former continues

which they call Works of <hi>Piety,</hi> which are no other than liberal
Contributions to <hi>Convents</hi> and <hi>Prieſts.</hi> They fail not to

                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> that arrogant piece of new <hi>Divinity,</hi>
which exalts the <hi>Clergy</hi> ſo far above the reſt of mankind, is of
great uſe to ſerve a Covetous deſign; The <hi>Pope</hi> muſt be the

muſt be the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and
<hi>Arch-Bishops</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> muſt be <hi>Lords</hi> and
<hi>Peers,</hi> and conſequently very rich to ſupport their Dignity. No
wonder therfore that the <hi>Church</hi> exacts Tribute from the whole Earth,
and hath got poſſeſſion of one <hi>half</hi> of the Wealth of
<hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> To this purpoſe doth <hi>Cardinal Pallavicini</hi>
argue in his <hi>Hiſtory of the Council of Trent.</hi> By this we ſee how
the <hi>Popish Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> turns altogether to the ſide of a diſhoneſt

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> let us conſider the Extraordinary <hi>Riches</hi> of the
<hi>Papacy.</hi> There is no <hi>Empire</hi> upon earth, which can equal it.
The <hi>City of Rome,</hi> and a very great part of <hi>Italy</hi> is intirely
their own. The Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> is held Feudatory from the
<hi>Pope.</hi> He is the temporal Lord of very conſiderable Lands, and large
Revenues, as the Cities of <hi>Liege,</hi> with the Country that depends upon
it, <hi>Cologne, Treves, Mentz.</hi> He did once poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs all thoſe
great Biſhopsticks of Germany, <hi>Saltſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, Munster, Oſnabrug,
Magdeburg, Paderborn,</hi> 
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:94715:71"/>and ſeveral others, whoſe
Biſhops are Soveraign <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and many <hi>Abbies,</hi> whoſe
Abbots are <hi>Princes,</hi> and members of the <hi>Empire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Papacy</hi> had all this: ſome part of it 'tis true is
loſt, but they yet retain a very conſiderable ſhare. How large are the
revenues of the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>France?</hi> There are
<hi>Lordships,</hi> and <hi>Dutchies,</hi> and <hi>Peerages,</hi> and
<hi>Bishopricks</hi> of a vaſt revenue, wealthy <hi>Abbies,</hi> and great
<hi>Commendoms.</hi> 'Tis the ſame in <hi>Spain,</hi> where all the
<hi>Prelates</hi> are more Potent than the <hi>King,</hi> even at this day.
<hi>England</hi> formerly was altogether the Territory of the Court of
<hi>Rome.</hi> All the reſt of <hi>Europe</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the ſame
condition. In a word, we may ſay truly, that the <hi>Papacy</hi> in its
height and glory was Maſter of more than half the Riches of <hi>Europe.</hi>
To ſpeak plainly, is this the <hi>Character</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, or of
Antichriſt? of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> who had not where to lay his head;
and foretold his Diſciples, that they muſt look for Poverty and
Tribulation, Diſtreſs and Suffering? How blind and ſottiſh muſt we
be, not to perceive that this prodigious Power and Riches is
<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian,</hi> exalting it ſelf upon the ruin both of true
<hi>Christianity,</hi> and of Chriſtian <hi>Princes.</hi>

to this height of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Riches.</hi> It was by unjuſt and
unlawful Means, by Impieties ſo horrible, that we muſt be altogether
inſenſible, ſtupid, and of a ſeared Conſcience not to take notice of
the working of the Man of Sin. The <hi>Reader</hi> would do well to peruſe
the treatiſe of <hi>Father Paul concerning Benefices.</hi> God permitted that
in theſe latter days, it ſhould be drawn out of Darkneſs, to open the
eyes of the moſt blind in this matter. 'Tis wrote in a grave ſtile, by a
learned Pen, without diſcovering any other deſign than to ſpeak the
Truth. 'Tis properly an <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> who
made uſe of one Knavery after another <pb n="119" facs="tcp:94715:71"/>to draw the
<hi>Riches</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi> into their Net. He had good reaſon to
begin the <hi>Hiſtory of Benefices,</hi> with the Inſtance of
<hi>Judas,</hi> who carried the Purſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Colledge, and for
Lucre of Money ſold his Maſter; for he was the true Forerunner of the
<hi>Bishop of Rome</hi> and his <hi>Clergy,</hi> and of the carriage of the
<hi>Church of Rome.</hi> There we ſee the Tricks and Cheats which the
<hi>Clergy</hi> uſed to perſuade the <hi>Laity</hi> to alienate their
<hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Revenues,</hi> to put them into the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of the <hi>Church:</hi> How the <hi>Clergy</hi> underſtood the knack of
getting money by <hi>Excommunications, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicts, Holy-wars,</hi> and the
Fewds of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Contentions between the <hi>Popes</hi> and
<hi>Emperors,</hi> the Diviſions of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Weakneſs of ſome
<hi>Princes,</hi> and the Superſtition of others, therby to attain to this
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious <hi>Wealth.</hi> When we ſee a beggar, one that was ſuch,
become of a ſudden immenſly rich, we need no other proof of his being a
Cheat and a Robber, and we may therupon charge him with it without
Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: for ſuch exceſſive Riches cannot be got by honeſt means.
To conſider the Prodigious Wealth of the <hi>Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> is ſufficient to
aſſure us, that they did not honeſtly come by it, but by Rapine, Fraud,
and Violence. The <hi>Church</hi> was poor, and had neither Gold nor Silver, in
thoſe days, when ſhe open'd the eyes of the Blind, and made the lame to
Walk: the Liberality of <hi>Christian Princes</hi> drew her out of this
Indigence; but it was to her unhappineſs and loſs; for as ſoon as ſhe
became <hi>Rich,</hi> ſhe became Covetous, Luxurious, and Wicked: and
becauſe thoſe Riches which ſhe got by the bounty of <hi>Princes,</hi> and
the well-meant (tho miſtaken) Piety of others, could not ſatisfie her
greedy deſire of more, no ſhamefull and diſhoneſt means have been
unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to acquire larger <hi>Revenues</hi> than ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and to
add more to what ſhe had already.</p>

               <p>Can we read without trembling the Robberies which ſeveral

every thing, as if it had been an Enemies Country conquer'd by the Sword. This
Character was given of one <hi>Pope, that he was an ambitious, Proud Creature,
inſatiable for money; that there were No crimes ſo black and horrid, which
he would not countenance and commit upon the promiſe of Money.</hi> 'Tis the

               </p>
               <p>The inſatiable avarice of the <hi>Papacy</hi> is ſo palpable
and notorious, that for ſeven or eight hundred <hi>years</hi> paſt,
ſcarce any Author, whether <hi>Hiſtorian, Poet,</hi> or <hi>Orator,</hi>
but hath imployed his Pen upon that ſubject. You may read the extract we have

               </p>
               <p>Some of 'em compare the <hi>Roman Church</hi> to a vaſt

fill it: others to a dreadful <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> in which are all ſorts of
Monſters, but no getting out of it, but by money the true <hi>Ariadne's

of baſe and carnal Paſſions, in the lives of thoſe famous Bishops, and

and ſelf-denial.</hi> It may very well be true, that in the lives which are

of their ſelling <hi>Pardons</hi> for Parricides, Inceſts, Buggeries,

this? will they ſay that theſe things are only Stories and Calumnies made
by <hi>Proteſtant Miniſters?</hi> Let the Proofs we bring be conſider'd,
and our witneſſes heard: we have a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude who affirm all this; ſome
of their Saints, <hi>Bernard, Thomas Aquinas, Anthoninus Arch-Bishop of

Clemengis, Sannazar, Alvarez Pelagius, Baptiſta Mantuan;</hi> in ſhort, all
the Honeſteſt men that the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> had for three or four
hundred years. Will they ſay, that the <hi>Church</hi> is not obliged to
anſwer this, and that we are not to make a Judgment concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a
<hi>Church</hi> by ſuch things as theſe? That's very pleaſant: by what
then ſhall we judge? Is not a Tree known by its Fruits? and a <hi>Church</hi>
by her Works? why muſt not the whole <hi>Roman Church</hi> be reſponſible
for an Abomination, whereof ſhe is guilty, both in her Head and Members? why
muſt we not lay that <pb n="123" facs="tcp:94715:73"/>to her charge? which was ſetled
both by Cuſtom and Law, by Rule and Practice?</p>
               <p>Will they ſay, that this is an old buſineſs, Crimes
committed long ago, and that we ought not to aſcribe it to the preſent
<hi>Roman Church,</hi> that is now recover'd, and ſound? were this true, I
muſt ſay again, ought we not to judge of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> by what
ſhe hath been for ſeven or eight hundred <hi>years</hi> together? If this
be a character of <hi>Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> as moſt certainly it is,
ſhall any one perſuade us that God would ever permit the True
<hi>Church</hi> to have this Character, during ſeven or eight Centuries? 'Tis
little more than an hundred <hi>years</hi> ſince the time of
<hi>Eſpencaeus,</hi> who wrote againſt this horrible <hi>Simony.</hi> The
diſtemper was then in its ſtrength, and the <hi>Church</hi> not cur'd: The
Clamors of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> had no place then.
But why do I urge this? are matters much mended in our days? Is not the ſame
trade driven at <hi>Rome</hi> now as formerly? ſelling
<hi>Diſpenſations,</hi> and <hi>Licences</hi> for all kinds of things,
<hi>Bulls</hi> for Tranſlations, Diſpenſations of Age, and for Marriages
in forbidden degrees, for Commendams, and a thouſand other things? what
Reformation hath been made as to any of theſe by the <hi>Council of
Trent?</hi> only that ſhe hath raiſed the price of
<hi>Diſpenſations,</hi> and that which heretofore might be had for a few
<hi>Pistols,</hi> will now coſt a conſiderable ſum; ſo that the
<hi>Rich</hi> only can get a Licence to <hi>Sin.</hi> If any man who is guilty
of <hi>Sodomy</hi> or <hi>Parricide</hi> make his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to the
<hi>Court of Rome</hi> for abſolution, may it not be obtain'd now, as well as
formerly? Do we not know that all things may be bought there for Money, as well
as in ſormertimes, tho now it be done with more ſecrecy, and in a manner
ſomewhat leſs ſcandalous? Let us ſee how the <hi>Court of Rome</hi> is

                  <note place="margin">Balzac.</note> one

friends, againſt Monſieur the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal P. whom he looks upon as a Turk and
an Infidel, if he happen to encounter him in the Conteſt for a Benefice or
ſome other dignity.</hi> Who knows not that to this day they cauſe money to
be brought to <hi>Rome</hi> from all parts of the World, by their <hi>Annates,
Bulls, Diſpenſations,</hi> and a thouſand other like methods? Some
whereof may be ſeen in the extract drawn out of Cardinal

deſcribe a <hi>Saint,</hi> they repreſent a <hi>Fool</hi> and a

Humility, and to make himſelf Contemtible, us'd to eaſe himſelf in the

and that he wiſht, that his Body after his death, might <hi>ſtink</hi> ſo

required ſuch things of us. We ſhall not cite any thing of the old
<hi>Legends,</hi> which may be rejected as ſillineſſes, that are now out
of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion; read the <hi>Panegyrick</hi> of S. <hi>Roſe,</hi> written a

<hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and turn'd into very elegant <hi>French</hi> by <hi>F.
Bouhours,</hi> another <hi>Jeſuite.</hi> There they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the moſt
ſottiſh and extravagant Idea of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity,</hi> that can enter into the
mind of man. This S. <hi>Roſe</hi> was a native of <hi>Lima,</hi> a City in
<hi>Peru.</hi> In her infancy, a certain inſpiration moved her to
conſecrate herſelf to God, and renounce the world. While <hi>she</hi> was a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:94715:79"/>very young Child; her mother having forced her to wear a
garland of Flowers, on a publick Feſtival, ſhe put Needles under the
Flowers, and ſtuck them ſo deep into her Head, that the skull was pierced,
ſo that a great deal of skill and ſtrength was neceſſary to pull them
out: After this, inſtead of a Crown of Flowers, <hi>she</hi> made herſelf
one of Nayles, which made a circle of great Wounds round about her head.
Becauſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had given her Beauty, every night <hi>she</hi> rubb'd over
her Face with an <hi>Indian</hi> powder, that was of ſo diſmal an acrimony,
that her whole face was cover'd with ugly and painful Sores. Becauſe a
Gentleman once commended the whiteneſs of her hands, <hi>she</hi> thruſt
them both into quick Lime, and held them there, till the Fleſh was waſted
away to the Bones. Her ordinary food, was the ſeeds of bitter Oranges, and
Gall. She would be ſix or ſeven dayes together, without drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and when
ſhe did drink (that ſhe might not dye of thirſt) ſhe took only a little
warm water. Every night, <hi>she</hi> diſciplin'd herſelf, with a heavy
Iron Chain, that wore off the fleſh, and bruiſed her very Bones. One day,
<hi>she</hi> girt this Chain ſo ſtrait about her, that it went into the
fleſh: ſhe lockt it with a Padlook, and threw the Key into a well. This
Chain fretted ſo deep, even to the Bones, that it grated on them: On this
manner, this wretched Creature, was like to periſh miſerably by a
lingering, and moſt tormenting death, and none could help her, for the
Padlock was lockt, the Key loſt, and her body being cover'd with ſores,
'twas impoſſible to uſe either hammer, or file to get off the Chain. But
the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> who had ſome work to do for S. <hi>Roſe,</hi>
came and delivered her from this Torture. After this (her Hiſtory tells us)
<hi>she</hi> made her ſelf a little Hut, (as it were a little <hi>Hermits
cell</hi>) at the further end of her Fathers Garden. The Flies, that annoy
thoſe climates, came preſently in multitudes, <pb n="135" facs="tcp:94715:79"/>and
fill'd the Cell. The <hi>Saint</hi> was ſadly tormented, and She who was ſo
in love with pain, yet could not endure this. <hi>She</hi> therefore made a
Treaty with the Flies, on theſe conditions; <hi>I will give you leave to
shelter your ſelves in my Cell, when exceſſive heat, or cold drives you
out of the Garden. I'le do you no hurt; and you shall promiſe to do me none.
Let us live in amity, that neither my hands kill you, nor your Stings wound
me.</hi> Theſe are her very words. Thus the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was made, and it was
honeſtly obſerved. The <hi>Saint</hi> made her a large Ring of Silver, in
which were faſtned ninety nine ſharp Nayles, in honour of the 33
<hi>years</hi> of Chriſt's Life, which number ſhe trebled in her round
plate and wore it under her Hair, that it might tear the skin of her head. Her
haircloth was made up with ſharp Needles, and of ſuch thick Hair, that her
Body was conſtantly cover'd with many bleeding wounds. <hi>She</hi> wore
ſharp Iron Pricks on her Feet; but finding, that thoſe parts were not
mortifyed enough by that, <hi>she</hi> put her feet to the mouth of a glowing
oven, and ſtirr'd not, till they were half burnt, and cover'd over with
Ulcers. Her Bed was made of very hard planks, without a Mattreſs, without
Blankets, or any coverings; on the planks thick logs of wood, at ſome
diſtances one from another, filling the empty ſpaces, with Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats, and
ſharp Pebbles; this was her bed. Theſe Stones pierced into the Planks; and
much more into her Fleſh, ſo that her Body was always cover'd with Blood,
with Bruſes, and wounds. Behold, after what manner this <hi>Saint</hi> lived
ſix and twenty years. We ought in Charity to believe, that the
<hi>Legend</hi> of this <hi>Saint,</hi> is a <hi>Romance,</hi> like the reſt:
and that there was never any perſon ſo ſottiſh, as to make a
<hi>ragouſt</hi> of ſuch a long and ſmarting torment. But ought we not to

ſenſe deſpiſe. But to what purpoſe is this? 'Tis ſo far from
diſproving our Evidence, that it ſtrengthens it. Theſe are ſo many
witneſſes for us, even among our very Enemies. Let <hi>Monſr.
Arnaud,</hi> and thoſe of his Character, call theſe Legendaries,
<hi>pitiful Authors,</hi> as much as they pleaſe; This is not at all
againſt us. For it muſt be granted, that for five or ſix hundred years,
theſe <hi>Legends</hi> were <hi>the Goſpel of the Papacy.</hi> The
<hi>Bible</hi> was a Book lockt up, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, utterly unknown by the
<hi>Laity;</hi> they know, read, heard nothing preacht, beſides theſe
imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies. No other <hi>Spirits</hi> came out of the mouth of the
<hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> and the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> Is it credible, that God
would ſuffer, that the true and real <hi>Church,</hi> ſhould for ſo many
Ages, be nouriſht with nothing, but this filth? Therefore, tho it ſhould be
true, that the Reign of this <hi>Legend-Goſpel,</hi> is paſt, and ended, is
it leſs true, that it laſted five or ſix hundred years? But I add, you
muſt not be over-perſuaded, that it is ended; Go into <hi>Spain,</hi> and
<hi>Italy,</hi> you will find that the Devotion of the people there, is ſtill
nouriſht with this diet. Know that the moſt learned, and grave

                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:94715:80"/>which the <hi>Papacy</hi> hath had in

<hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeline</hi> hath in this <hi>Age,</hi> given us in his elegant Latin
the <hi>Legend</hi> of our <hi>Lady of Loretta,</hi> together with all her

hath wrote <hi>Books</hi> to propagate ſuch <hi>Fables.</hi> And but the

the <hi>Legends.</hi> For before the <hi>Reformation</hi> the ſermons in the
<hi>Church of Rome,</hi> were nothing but Stories, and Fables taken out of the
<hi>Legends.</hi> The ſame unclean ſpirit (coming out of the Mouth of the
falſe Prophet) is to be diſcern'd in them. When for a long time, the
<hi>Pulpits</hi> had been forſaken by the ordinary <hi>Incumbents,</hi> the
Mendicant <hi>Friars</hi> took poſſeſſion of them: The <hi>Bishops</hi>
and <hi>Curates</hi> lived in a ſtupid Lethargy, and a brutal Ignorance; The
<hi>Priests</hi> ſcarce underſtood <hi>Latin</hi> enough to read and ſay
<hi>Maſs;</hi> and at the ſame time lived in Drunkenneſs, Whoring, and
the moſt horrid Diſorders; the <hi>Monks</hi> finding the <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits</hi>
forſaken, entred into poſſeſſion of them. But good God! what kind of
Preachers! Their Sermons were heaps of Extravagancies. If they were to preach
of Charity, or of the Paſſion of Chriſt, they took their
<hi>Exordiums</hi> from the heads of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiz'd upon
the <hi>Twelve Signes</hi> of the <hi>Zodiack.</hi> They read a Text for
faſhion ſake, but came not near it by many miles. The <hi>Fryar</hi>
ſpake neither of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> nor S. <hi>Paul:</hi> he cited only the
Seraphick and Angelick <hi>Doctor,</hi> the ſubtil, the Irrefragable
<hi>Doctor.</hi> He fell upon ſome thorny School controverſy, of which he
diſcourſt in barbarous language. As to <hi>Morality,</hi> they put off
ſome cold and childiſh allegories, ſome wreſted applications of Texts
of Scripture, ſome ridiculous pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſes <pb n="138" facs="tcp:94715:81"/>on
Scripture paſſages: ſome ſottiſh notions, (which were taken for
flights of Wit, and efforts of Imagination) ſome ridiculous Fables, which
were often obſcence and filthy. We may ſee the proofs of all this, in the
printed <hi>Sermons</hi> of that time, which are come down to us. <hi>Menot,
Oliver Maillard, Barelett</hi> are at this day the Varities of
<hi>Libraries,</hi> and thoſe who are curious, preſerve them as Originals
of Impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And in truth, tho at this day the <hi>Popish Pulpits,</hi>
eſpecially in <hi>France,</hi> are amended; there remains enough in the
<hi>Sermons</hi> of the <hi>Monks,</hi> and in their Countrey
<hi>Preachers,</hi> to convince us, at what rate they formerly preacht.</p>

and Debauchery. But in what doth the <hi>Monkish Devotion</hi> conſiſt? In
erecting Fraternities, as they call them; among which the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal are that
of the <hi>Roſary</hi> of the <hi>Jacopins,</hi> that of the

<hi>Arch-fraternities.</hi> The grand buſineſs of the <hi>Monks,</hi> is to

that can be found; but eſpecially <hi>Women</hi> who are rich, and have the

full pardon of all ſins is granted to thoſe, who ſhall wear theſe marks
of the <hi>Beaſt:</hi> On the other hand, every <hi>Order,</hi> turns the
devotions of the reſt into ridicule. While the <hi>Dominican</hi> cryes up
the Virtues of his <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi> he jeers at the <hi>Scapulary</hi> of

Idolatry.</note>Let us ſee, if this Character be found in the
<hi>Papacy,</hi> It is <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> 1. In the Adoration of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> in giving divine Honours, &amp; divine Attributes to him,
<hi>viz.</hi> a divine Power, and an Univerſal Authority, which are put in
his hands. 2. The <hi>Papacy</hi> is guilty of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> in the
Adoration of the <hi>Sacrament of the Altar,</hi> which is nothing but Bread,
and yet all divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours are given it. 3. It is <hi>Idolatrous</hi> in the
account of the <hi>Invocation of Saints;</hi> for the worſhip which is given
to the <hi>Virgin,</hi> to <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> makes them
ſecond-rate Gods; to whom Honour of the ſame kind are orderd to be given,
that are given to the Great God. 4. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The <hi>Papacy</hi> is
<hi>Idolatrous,</hi> becauſe it obligeth men to fall down before
<hi>Images</hi> of Wood, of Stone, of Gold and Silver. The <hi>Idolatry</hi> of

owned by all the Members of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> or as it is explain'd by
the bygotted <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> who are exceſſive in
every thing, and keep no bounds. Thus, the <hi>Idolatry</hi> as to
<hi>Images</hi> may be conſidered, either as layd down in the
<hi>Decrees</hi> of their <hi>Councills,</hi> or in the modern ſoftning
explication, by which 'tis palliated, or in the Practice and downright Divinity
of true <hi>Papiſts.</hi> I will not here undertake to prove the charge of
<hi>Idolatry</hi> upon the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> on the account of the
<hi>Services,</hi> which ſhe Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by her <hi>Canons,</hi> and the

The Virgin is the Queen-regent of Paradiſe, the Country of Grace and Mercy.
The Treaſures of the H. Spirit were given her as her dowry, and Paradiſe as
her Portion: Therefore all the Gates of Heaven are at her devotion. 'Tis thro

Virgin hath done more, or as much for God, as God hath done for mankind.
Ieſus Chriſt by imitating the Virtues of <hi>Mary,</hi> diſcharged his

She is the Book of Life. She merited to be the mother of God, and to be the
Mother of all Mankind. Every thing that is ſpiritual flowes from Ieſus as
the Father, and from <hi>Mary</hi> as the Mother of it. She is more merciful to
Sinners, that Ieſus Chriſt: 'Tis not poſſible, that thoſe should be
ſaved, from whom <hi>Mary</hi> turns away the eyes of her Mercy: and 'tis
abſolutely neceſſary, that thoſe should be juſtifyed, toward whom she
turns her Eyes. <pb n="149" facs="tcp:94715:86"/>'Tis againſt her alone that we ſin. If

becauſe ſhe toucht our Saviour, the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <pb n="150" facs="tcp:94715:87"/>of

brought back as it were from the Gates of Hell, becauſe they had been her
Votaries. And as an evidence, how highly pleaſing this Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to the

laſt ſeven or eight hundred <hi>years,</hi> than God hath wrought ſnice
the <hi>Creation,</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets, by Jeſus

<hi>Images</hi> have Spoken, they have Sung, they have reſiſted the Fire,
and the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, they have ſored in the Air like Birds, they have ſwet
Blood, and Oyle and Milk have run from them; ſome of them have been turn'd
into Fleſh; they have Wept, Lamented, Groaned; they have made the Lame to
Walk, the Blind to See, the Deaf to Hear. They have cured all kinds of
Diſeaſes, and Wrought all ſorts of Prodigies. For theſe reaſons,
people will go to the end of the World, to viſit theſe conſecrated
<hi>Images,</hi> they kiſs, and fall down before them, and render to them an
external Worſhip, accompanyed with a moſt fervent internal devotion. They
rubb their Chaplets, or Beads, their Handkercheifs, upon theſe
<hi>Images,</hi> and wear about them theſe Chaplets, and cloths, which have
touched the <hi>Images</hi> of the <hi>Virgin:</hi> and believe, that they are
reliques which have a virtue to preſerve from all Evills. That which we have

Exceſſes. Indeed, how can it be, that men ſhould not ſee the

to the Creator? To aſcribe juſt every thing to the <hi>Virgin,</hi> which
can be ſpoken of <hi>God,</hi> and conſequently to give her divine Honours?
Thoſe Gentlemen, who make it an Article of their faith to follow the
ſentiments of a certain <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick,</hi> who wrote, <hi>The
wholſom Advices of the Virgin to her indiſcreet Votaries;</hi> tell us,
that the things charged, are the Exceſſes of ſome <hi>Fryars,</hi> which
were never approved by the <hi>Church;</hi> that no <hi>Council</hi> ever
enjoyn'd them; that at preſent, all thoſe Follies are antiquated; that men
are perfectly come off from 'em; and that the <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi>
muſt not be judged of by that meaſure. And therefore, if we have no other
Arguments, to make good the charge of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> 
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:94715:88"/>that we bring againſt the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> we muſt be
non-ſuted. This is their note for theſe laſt twelve or fifteen

yea they write, and print it, that all thoſe who revive theſe
<hi>Monkish</hi> Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are ſome pitiful <hi>Jeſuites,</hi>
ſuch fellows as <hi>F. Craſſet.</hi> They tell us, that when we pray to

pray. And that we pray to them, on the ſame ground and deſign that we

<hi>Idolatry;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tho we could not reproach the <hi>Church of

to convict her of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> We ſay in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>

'tis enough to us, that theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen do acknowledge, that theſe

it, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Advices,</hi> &amp;c. does ſtrongly prove it.
This acknowledgment, I ſay, is enough to us, to found an Accuſation of
<hi>Idolatry</hi> againſt the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and to evince, that
ſhe bears this Character of <hi>Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> as well as the
reſt. 'Tis a meer Cavil, to ſay, that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> can only be
charged with that ſhe hath expreſly determined in her <hi>Councils.</hi>
The univerſal conſent, the conſtant practice of her <hi>people,</hi> the
uniform Theology of all her <hi>Doctors,</hi> the Orders and Examples of her
<hi>Popes,</hi> and laſtly, the toleration, or rather the long reign of
theſe Abominations, without the leaſt contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, are ſufficient to

                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:94715:88"/>and that all her Teachers, have

it, by their Decrees, by their Examples, by the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Hymns, which

               <p>We defy M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Arnaud,</hi> and all the refin'd
<hi>Papiſts</hi> at this day, to cite the Authors, who have dared to condemn
theſe Exceſſes. We eaſily believe, that there have been ſome, who
have neither approved, nor practis'd them. But the number hath been ſo
ſmall, and the torrent ſo violent againſt them, that they had been burnt,
if they had taken the courage to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themſelves. 'Tis ſo publickly
notorious, that nothing can be more, that before the <hi>Reformation,</hi> God
and his Worſhip were ſcarce known by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people: Nothing was talked

by thoſe of the <hi>Virgin;</hi> Vows and Prayers made to <hi>He</hi>-Saints,

principal Authors of theſe diſmal Exceſſes, which men are forc't to be
aſham'd of at this day. Such was the torrent of this impiety, that thoſe
who were not born down with it, were forced to conceal themſelves, ſo that
'tis no wonder, that we of this age cannot name and ſhew them. Theſe
Gentlemen, when we tell them, that God reſerved his <hi>Elect,</hi> hidden in
<hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> do inſultingly ask us, Where were thoſe, who denyed to

ſufficient to ſtop the mouthes of theſe Gentlemen, the Advocates of
<hi>Popery,</hi> whoſe deformities they conceal with ſo much cunning. The
<hi>Firſt</hi> is, That in their publick <hi>Hymns</hi> authoriſed by the
<hi>Church,</hi> publickly ſung, printed in their <hi>Miſſials</hi> and
<hi>Hours,</hi> we find theſe ſame Superſtitions, which they own to be
<hi>Exceſſes,</hi> and we call <hi>Blaſphemies</hi> and
<hi>Idolatries.</hi> Have they not ſung in one of the Hymns of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church, <hi>monſtra te eſſe matrem; shew yourſelf to be
his mother, i.e.</hi> command your Son with the Authority of a Mother. Did ever
any private Author ſay anything more horrid, than this, that a Creature
ſhould in a way of Authority command its Creator? Are there not theſe words
in an antient Hymn, <hi>poſitus in medio quo me vertam neſcio;</hi> which
are ſpoken by a <hi>Devotioniſt,</hi> plac'd between Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and
the Virgin, and knoweth not which of them to prefer? They were not therefore
meer private perſons, who were guilty of theſe Exceſſes. Our
<hi>ſecond</hi> Evidence is this, that theſe Blaſphemies have come out of
the Mouthes of the <hi>Popes</hi> themſelves; of <hi>Popes,</hi> I ſay, who
are the Mouth of Jeſus Chriſt, and who cannot err, as 'twas univerſally
ſuppoſed in thoſe times. Was it not Pope <hi>Innocent III.</hi> who
compoſed that Hymn, in which theſe words are found, <hi>Precor te Regina
Coeli habeas me excuſatum, nam peccavi tibi ſoli, i. e. I beſeech Thee, O
Queen of Heaven, to forgive me, for 'tis againſt</hi> Thee <hi>only I have
ſinn'd?</hi> Is not this to put the <hi>Virgin</hi> in the place of
<hi>God,</hi> the great Lawgiver and ſoveraign? Our <hi>third Proof</hi> is
this, that the <hi>Authors</hi> 
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:94715:89"/>of this extravagant
Devotion, whoſe worſhip is full of Blaſphemy, have yet been
<hi>canoniz'd.</hi> One of theſe <hi>Saints</hi> is Cardinal
<hi>Bonaventure,</hi> another is <hi>Antonine</hi> Arch-Biſhop of
<hi>Florence.</hi> There are others, as St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardin,</hi> St.
<hi>Anſelme,</hi> &amp;c. Did the <hi>Church</hi> at that time look upon
theſe men with the ſame eye as Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> now doth? would he
increaſe the number of <hi>Saints</hi> by the names of thoſe whom he
ſtiles Wretched Authors, and Pittiful Fellows, ſuch as Father
<hi>Craſſet,</hi> and other ſorry <hi>Ieſuites?</hi> A <hi>fourth</hi>
Argument we may fetch from their <hi>Expurgatory Indexes.</hi> If theſe
<hi>Monkish</hi> Superſtitions have been lookt upon as extravagant and
exceſſive, ever ſince the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> why are they not
condemn'd? why are they not raz'd out of their Writings? why are not the Books
forbidden? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do we not find them in ſome <hi>Index</hi> of forbidden
Books? and there have been many ſuch printed at <hi>Rome</hi> and in
<hi>Spain</hi> within an hundred and fifty years. On the Contrary, Theſe
Authors have been in vogue, and as much eſteem'd as formerly; theſe
Idolatrous <hi>Saints</hi> have kept their place in the <hi>Calender,</hi> and
their <hi>Statues</hi> been continued in <hi>Churches,</hi> their
<hi>Worship</hi> in the <hi>Roman ſervice,</hi> and their
<hi>Feſtivals</hi> in the days of the <hi>year:</hi> After this they muſt
be very impudent to tell us, that theſe exceſſive and extravagant
<hi>Devotions</hi> were not the general <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Roman
Church</hi> for ſeven or eight hundred <hi>years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">This Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion which thus
borders upon Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try doth yet continue.</note>As to that which theſe
Gentlemen tell us, that this is a thing paſt and gone, and ought not to be
jmputed to the preſent <hi>Roman Church,</hi> becauſe they are not now
guilty, but have reformed and brought back the <hi>Invocation of Saints</hi> to
what it ought to be. To this, I ſay, divers things may be anſwered;
<hi>Firſt,</hi> that granting the truth of this, it would nevertheleſs be
true, that the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> hath been <hi>Idolatrous</hi> for
ſeven or eight hundred <hi>years,</hi> and this were enough to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie 
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:94715:90"/>our Charge of <hi>Idolatry</hi> againſt her, and to
prove the Character of the Kingdom of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> belongs to the
<hi>Papacy.</hi> But I ſay further, that this Aſſertion implies a much
greater Impudence, than the former Excuſe; for the darkneſs we are under as
to former times, might ſerve for a pretence in the denial of a matter of Fact
concerning thoſe times; but all ſhame muſt be loſt in thoſe that will
conteſt a preſent Truth, and affirm that which our ſenſes will evidence
to be falſe, whereof we may every day ſee the contrary. What ought we then
to judge of our modern <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> who ſo confidently aſſure
their <hi>now Converts,</hi> that all that was exceſſive in the Worſhip
of <hi>Saints</hi> is now corrected and amended. Is there any one thing abated
of what we Charge them with? do they not every day <hi>ſing</hi> in their
<hi>Churches</hi> thoſe blaſphemous <hi>Hymns</hi> againſt <hi>God,</hi>
and againſt the B. <hi>Virgin,</hi> that we accuſe 'em of? wherin they call
her. <hi>The Tree of Life; the Well of Living Water; the Ocean of Graces; the
Light of the Church; the Light of Hearts; the Buckler of Mankind; the Refuge of
Mortals; the Queen of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells; the Princeſs of Seraphims; the Ark of the
Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; the Holy Altar; the Repairer of all that</hi> Adam <hi>ſpoil'd;
the Judge of Quick and Dead.</hi> Was there any thing worſe than this ever
ſaid by the <hi>Bonaventure's, Albertus's, Antonine's, Biel's, &amp;c?</hi>
If the <hi>Virgin</hi> be the Light of the Living and of the Dead, who
inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens every man that comes into the world; if ſhe be the <hi>Altar</hi>
of our Propitiation; the <hi>Aſylom</hi> to which all men muſt have
recourſe; if <hi>she</hi> hath reſtor'd all that <hi>Adam</hi> loſt, what
remains for Jeſus Chriſt to do? and what could be ſaid more of himſelf?
Is this paſt and gone? doth it not ſtill continue? Is it not dayly
<hi>ſung</hi> in the Hymns and Letanies of the <hi>Virgin?</hi> what
Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority reduc'd the Church to the Truth in the point of the Invocation and
Worſhip of <hi>Saints?</hi> It may be <pb n="157" facs="tcp:94715:90"/>the <hi>Council of
Trent?</hi> but have not the greateſt part of theſe extravagant Authors we
have quoted, liv'd ſince the Council of <hi>Trent?</hi> The <hi>Author of the
ſigns of Predeſtination,</hi> the <hi>Stellarium, Binnet, Salmeron,
Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lazar, Coſterus, Vaſquez, Father Suffren, Carolus Scribanius,</hi> and
an hundred others, who have liv'd in our age, have they abated any thing? on
the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, have they not out-done their Predeceſſors? ſo far is the
Idolatrous worſhip of the <hi>Virgin</hi> diminiſht, that within an
<hi>hundred years</hi> it is very much augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The opinion of the
<hi>Immaculate Conception of the Virgin</hi> was once a Probleme, a
diſputable point; but in our times the <hi>Monks</hi> have almoſt made it
an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Faith. No man durſt preach or write againſt it; and ſince
that time the votaries of the <hi>Virgin</hi> have kept no meaſures.
<hi>Kingdoms</hi> are put under her Protection, and every Individual takes her
for his Patroneſs: new <hi>Temples</hi> and <hi>Chappels</hi> are every day
built to her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How thoſe have far'd who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd this
Exceſs.</note>It may yet be ſaid, that there are ſome in the <hi>Church
of Rome</hi> who condemn this exceſs. <hi>Mr. Arnaud</hi> in his <hi>Apology
for the Catholicks,</hi> cites his good Friend the <hi>Bishop</hi> of
<hi>Caſtoria, M. Pavillon</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Alet,</hi> and ſome
others: and above all, we have the <hi>Advice of the H. Virgin to her
Indiſcreet Votaries,</hi> which takes away all Theſe abuſes. But theſe
ſorts of writings, which are but a few, are ſo far from convincing us that
this <hi>Idolatry</hi> is paſt, that it teaches us the contrary, that it is
yet in vigor. At that very time when that little <hi>Book</hi> came forth,
there were thoſe who ſaid, <hi>That a man might be aſſur'd of his
ſalvation tho he liv'd in Sin, if he did but bear any devotion to the Virgin:
that God could not damn thoſe who had any external Devotion to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin:
that Devotion to the Virgin was a ſign of Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: that the virgin
brought back her votaries from Hell, to give 'em ſpace to repent: that a man
might be <pb n="158" facs="tcp:94715:91"/>ſaved without the Love of God, if he apply'd
himſelf to our Lady: that a man might render all Honours to the Virgin, tho
he forgot that which was due unto God: that the Virgin is more merciful than J.
Christ: that the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin is an Inferior Divinity, without whom there can be no
acceſs to God: that she is the Mediatrix of Mankind, and hath a great deal of
Merit, which she never receiv'd from her Son: that she is the Joynt-Redeemer
and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World with J. Chriſt: that we may appeal from God's
Tribunal to hers: that she hath an Empire and Kingdom diſtinct from that of
the Father: that she may be plac't parallell with her Son: that Mercy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to her, but Juſtice to Chriſt: that we may apply our ſelves only to her,
and neglect her Son: that Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Virgin may be prefer'd to the Love
of God, and truſt in him: that we may put our confidence in Images: and that
a difference is to be made between the ſeveral Images of the virgin, as to
efficacy and vertue, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that there muſt be a difference in
our Devotion to 'em.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If thoſe wicked and abominable Extravagancies are paſt and
forgotten, this modern <hi>Author</hi> was much to blame, to give ſo
particular an account of them, in order to his charge againſt them; that
could be of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe but to revive 'em. But for the fuller conviction that
theſe Impieties are ſtill the Religion of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> we muſt
conſider how that Book, <hi>The Advice of the Virgin, &amp;c.</hi> Was
receiv'd; <hi>viz.</hi> as an <hi>Heretical</hi> Book. Father
<hi>Craſſet,</hi> a famous <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> wrote an anſwer to it: he
treats the <hi>Author</hi> in his Preface as one that deſerv'd the
<hi>Inquiſition;</hi> and 'tis certain, had he been in the hands of the
<hi>Spanish Inquiſitors,</hi> they would have burnt him as a
<hi>Lutheran.</hi> In a word, Father <hi>Craſſet</hi> confutes him, and
eſtabliſheth all thoſe Impieties which the other had condemn'd: he doth,
I ſay, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh and confirm 'em one after another; proving the 
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:94715:91"/>truth of 'em, and the Piety of the practice of theſe
things, ſupporting his own Opinion by the teſtimony many hundred
<hi>Authors,</hi> which he thinks of great weight; and this <hi>Book</hi> is
printed with Approbation, and Priviledge, and ſold publickly throughout all
<hi>France.</hi> On the contrary, the Book of <hi>The Advice,</hi> &amp;c. and
other ſuch pieces, are diſperſt very ſecretly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing the Authors
names, and with evident tokens of being diſlik't and diſcountenanc't. 'Twas
not long ago that the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> of <hi>Rheims</hi> caus'd this
Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be put upon the Frontiſpiece of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, 
<q>Deo Homini &amp; Beato Franciſco, Utrique Crucifixo.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To God-man, and to S. Francis, who were both
Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</hi> Some or other abhorring this <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> wrote
againſt it, but was forc't to hide himſelf under the name of <hi>S.
Saviour,</hi> and to print his paper with great Secrecy.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Few at this day dare openly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn theſe
extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note>In the mean while, it may be ſaid, that there are great

grant and believe it; and 'tis that which makes me hope that <hi>Popery</hi>
will ere long be baniſht out of <hi>France:</hi> but it muſt be obſerved,

his death, among his Papers were found <hi>Bulis</hi> and <hi>Letters</hi> of
Filiation that he had procur'd, to have a part in the merits of the
<hi>Monks;</hi> we alſo mention'd the Example of the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> of
<hi>Rheims,</hi> one of thoſe who would <pb n="160" facs="tcp:94715:92"/>be thought to be

<hi>Confrairies</hi> of S. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> to be ſet up in his
Metropolitan City, with all kinds of Indulgence annext, plenary, fuller, and
moſt full. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> we have given the Relation of a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of
Fact, which all <hi>Paris</hi> is witneſs to, and whereof the Narrative hath
been printed; 'Tis the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Reliques</hi> which the

judged you would be glad to read a copy of, the ſubject of it was this.
A</hi> Benedictine Father, <hi>of the Convent in this</hi> City, <hi>who
preacht the laſt Lent at</hi> Duras, <hi>made a ſermon on the day of</hi>
our Lady in March, <hi>wherein he made uſe of ſeveral very bold and
extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Expreſſions, concerning the veneration due to the</hi> H.
Virgin, <hi>in ſo much that not only</hi> New Converts, <hi>but many of the
ancient</hi> Catholicks <hi>were ſcandaliz'd at it; among others that were
offended, were the</hi> Curate, <hi>and the Firſt</hi> Conſul <hi>of
the</hi> City, <hi>who ſent their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to this</hi> Preacher, <hi>to
have had him repair that fault in his next ſermon. But as he reſus'd to do
ſo, every one on either ſide took care to give an account to Monſieur
the</hi> Biſhop <hi>of</hi> Agen, <hi>formerly</hi> Biſhop <hi>of</hi>
Tulle, <hi>and known under the name of Father</hi> Maſcaron. <hi>About</hi> 8
<hi>or</hi> 10 <hi>days after the preaching of the firſt ſermon, this</hi>
Father <hi>at the cloſe of another told the people, that having underſtood
that ſome had been offended without cauſe at his</hi> Sermon <hi>on
our</hi> Ladies day, <hi>he had given the</hi> Biſhop <hi>an account of it,
who did perfectly approve all that he had ſaid. Whereupon the</hi> Curate
<hi>replied with a loud voice in the preſence of the whole Aſsembly, that
it was not ſo, and that he himſelf could produce Letters to the
contrary.</hi>

               <p>The Character of this <hi>Bishop</hi> is well known, that of all
men in the Kingdom he hath the greateſt contempt and ſcorn for the
<hi>monkish Devotions:</hi> and yet you ſee how he talks, how he ſaith,
that the Impious Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of that <hi>Monk</hi> had, and might have, a
very good ſenſe. He doth not require of the <hi>Monk</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract

it plainly ſignifies thus much, <hi>that theſe Devotions are ſtill the
Religion of the People in the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> that they would not have 'em
ſcandaliz'd by diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving them, and that they durſt not oppoſe the

the Father. The true Worshippers are they, who worship in Spirit and in Truth,
God is a Spirit, and they who worship him, muſt worship him in Spirit and in
Truth, &amp;c.</hi> 'Tis plain that the <hi>Spirit</hi> and a Spiritual
<hi>Service</hi> are there appos'd to the Carnal, Bodily, Ceremonial Service of
the Ancient <hi>Church.</hi> S. Paul ſpeaks in like manner to the Romans.
<hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you Brethren by the Mercies of God, that you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent your

               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, <hi>Judaiſm</hi> had a corporal worship, bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exerciſe, but it was reaſonable, being full of deep myſteries, of types,
and leſſons of piety; but the worſhip of the <hi>Heathens</hi> had
neither Spirituality nor reaſon. <hi>Chriſtian worship</hi> is altogether
both <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Rational.</hi> Nothing can be more Rational
than to pray to God, to ſing his praiſe, to offer him thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, to
hear his word and preach it, to keep his commandments, to receive the ſign of
our waſhing in Baptiſm, and of our Spiritual nouriſhment in the Sacrament

Spirituality, and of Reaſon, as there is of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> therfore
we find there pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God, and Thanksgivings, and Sacraments. But ſo far
forth as <hi>Popery</hi> hath made additions to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> there
is nothing that is either <hi>Spiritual,</hi> or <hi>Rational.</hi>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> their <hi>worship</hi> is covered under

but the outſide, a frightfull carnal bark and cover, that were only for the
eye: wherin even the ear can have no part, but with reſpect to the ſymphony
and Harmony of ſounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> All that we ſee is meerly corporeal;
<hi>viz. Churches</hi> adorn'd with extraordinary pride and pomp, wherin is a
glimmering Light mixt with darkneſs, but inlightned with Lamps and candles,
with niches in the walls, where we ſee Images of a Curious ſculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in
rich and magnifick habits: They who ſerve at their <hi>Altars</hi> have
extraordinary garments both for matter and form, and ſometimes for coſt
too: the <hi>ſervice</hi> is not ſaid but ſung with Muſick, and the
<hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> of Great and Feſtival days accompanied with
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental and vocal Muſick.</p>
               <p>The Body of the <hi>Clergy</hi> with all the <hi>People</hi>
march often in great pomp, a Croſs lifted up, and banners diſplaid, and
ſo walk thro the ſtreets and ſometimes the fields with this equipage. The
<hi>shrine</hi> of a <hi>Saint</hi> is ſometimes carried in this manner,
before which one cries, that <hi>all muſt kneel,</hi> and all the people are
preſently on their knees. Every year The <hi>God</hi> made by a
<hi>Priest</hi> is carried in great pomp, all the ſtreets eccho with joy; all
places thro which they paſs with this Ceremony are adorn'd with Tapiſtry
and Pictures, and the ſtreets covered with Flowers: nothing can be more like
the pomp of <hi>Iſis,</hi> a part whereof is deſcribed by
<hi>Apuleius.</hi> Is this a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>Rational</hi>
worſhip? Is not this like the <hi>Heathen</hi> worſhip, who carried their
<hi>Gods</hi> in proceſſion upon ſacred Chariots, which they called
<hi>Thenſae Deorum?</hi> Is not this to make <hi>Religion</hi> a meer
ſpectacle, a kind of Comedie? In ſhort, all the devotion 
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:94715:96"/>of the <hi>People</hi> comes to this, to look upon
<hi>Proceſſions,</hi> the <hi>shrines</hi> and <hi>Reliques</hi> of
<hi>Saints,</hi> the <hi>Ciborium</hi> where they put the <hi>H. Sacrament,
Altars, Ornaments, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtrys, Pictures, Images, Crucifixes, Prieſts</hi>
Habits, <hi>Canopies,</hi> and the magnificence of the <hi>Train,</hi> which
follows according to Ceremony. The Imagination and the Heart likewiſe are
fill'd with this glittering outſide, and gawdy ſhow, which is ſo far from
eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſoul to God, as is pretended, that it ſtops and hinders it
from mounting higher than to what is meerly external and earthly.</p>
               <p>They pretend that this <hi>worship</hi> of theirs is very
ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and full of Myſteries. The <hi>Prieſt</hi> puts the
<hi>Amict</hi> upon his head, which is the name of his <hi>hood;</hi> this
ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, they tell us, the Divinity of Jeſus Chriſt, which was hidden
and concealed under his Paſſion. He puts on the <hi>Albe</hi> or white
ſurplice over his other cloaths, becauſe it is written, <hi>thy garments
shall be white,</hi> and this to denote the Innocence of thoſe who ſerve at
the Altar. The <hi>Subdeacon</hi> in ſome places kiſſes the right hand of
the <hi>Priest</hi> who doth officiate, becauſe <hi>the right hand of the
moſt High hath done valiantly.</hi> The <hi>Prieſt</hi> or the
<hi>Bishop</hi> doth ſit down after the <hi>prayer,</hi> in remembrance of
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt's fitting in the Temple to diſpute with the Doctors
of the Law. In a word, there is not the moſt minute and trifling
<hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> of their <hi>worship</hi> but hath its myſtical and
ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual reaſon aſſign'd for't. But Firſt, theſe are meer
Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maera's and fancies, which the firſt Inventers of theſe Ceremonies
never dreamt of; we are told of a learned <hi>man</hi> in the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> a Canon of <hi>Clugny,</hi> who hath prepared a book for the
preſs, that will confute and ſhame the <hi>Durand's,</hi> the
<hi>Biels,</hi> the <hi>Innocent's</hi> and the Diſciples of ſuch as have
wrote of the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of the <hi>Maſs;</hi> for he will prove,
that all theſe <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are without any myſtery, and that they
were only <pb n="170" facs="tcp:94715:97"/>inſtituted upon motives of commodity and
conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, or by meer hazard and occaſion; but ſuppoſe there were a
myſterious Intention hidden under theſe Ceremonies, were the ſervice any
whit the leſs carnal for this? who allmoſt is there that underſtands
theſe <hi>Mysteries?</hi> A man muſt have been for a long time in a dream,
to have imagin'd thoſe impertinent reaſons which are brought by the
<hi>myſtical Authors</hi> of the Roman Church for all the parts of their
external wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. The <hi>Priests</hi> themſelves do not know them: and
the <hi>People</hi> never heard one word concerning them; ſo that they never
ſee any thing but bodily exerciſe, and a worſhip meerly corporeal and
external.</p>
               <p>The moſt important piece of <hi>worship</hi> in the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> is the <hi>Maſs;</hi> let us examin it a little, whether it
hath thoſe two Characters of being <hi>Spiritual</hi> and
<hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,</hi> which are certainly two properties of every
<hi>Service</hi> in the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> In the <hi>Maſs</hi>
the <hi>Prieſt</hi> being cloath'd with his Sacerdotal Habit begins with
that, which they call, the <hi>Judica,</hi> the <hi>Introitus,</hi> and the
<hi>Confiteor.</hi> There ſome words taken out of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> are
thruſt in, and mixt with ſome words of prayer. The <hi>Prieſt</hi> makes
confeſſion of his ſins to <hi>God,</hi> to the <hi>Virgin,</hi> and to
the <hi>Saints:</hi> he demands <hi>abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and he beſtows it on
the People, he aſcendes to the <hi>Altar,</hi> he ſtoops down below it, and
mutters ſome prayers to himſelf, of which no body underſtands either the
ſenſe or the ſound. He ſays to the People, <hi>Cantate Domino, i.
e.</hi> ſing to the Lord, and yet no man dares ſing. He repeats ſeveral
times, <hi>Kirie Elei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Chriſte Eleiſon,</hi> Greek words, whoſe
meaning he knows not; for 'tis very common that he ſcarce under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the
<hi>Latine</hi> of the <hi>Maſs.</hi> The <hi>Gradual</hi> is the ſecond
part of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> in which he ſings ſome kind of ſongs, that
are different according to the time and Days on which <hi>Maſs</hi> is read:
the <hi>Deacon</hi> prepares <pb n="171" facs="tcp:94715:97"/>himſelf to read the
Goſpell, he prays to God in <hi>Latin</hi> that he would purify his Lips: the
<hi>Prieſt</hi> gives him his bleſſing, and makes many ſigns of the
<hi>Croſs</hi> over him. The <hi>Deacon</hi> kiſſeth the hand of the
<hi>Prieſt,</hi> and makes the ſign of the <hi>Croſs</hi> with the
<hi>thumb</hi> of his right hand over the <hi>Book,</hi> over
<hi>himſelf,</hi> upon his forehead, his mouth, and ſtomach, he perfumes
the <hi>Book</hi> with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and being thus well armed againſt the
charms of the Devill by his Grimace and wry-faces, he reads the Goſpell of
the day, but the poor <hi>People</hi> in the mean while underſtand nothing.
The reading being over, the <hi>Prieſt</hi> returns the Book, ſaying
theſe words, <hi>Per Evangelica dicta deleantur noſtra Delicta; i. e.</hi>
by the ſayings of the Goſpell may our ſins be blotted out. The
<hi>Deacon</hi> burns Incenſe: the <hi>Prieſt</hi> reads the Creed, and
turning towards the <hi>People,</hi> he ſays, <hi>Dominus
vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſcum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the <hi>Gradual</hi> comes the <hi>Offertory,</hi> in
which the <hi>Prieſt</hi> taking the diſh wherin are the unconſecrated
<hi>wafers,</hi> he offers them unto God with theſe words, <hi>Holy Father,
God Almighty and Eternal, receive this immaculate ſacrifice which I thine
unworthy ſervant offer unto Thee my living and true God, for my innumerable
ſins, offences, and negligences, and for all thoſe who are here preſent
round about, and for all faith full Chriſtians Living and Dead, that it might
be profitable to their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in Eternal Life.</hi> Obſerve that 'tis
all this while but meer <hi>bread:</hi> But what kind of Bread think ye? little
looſe leaves of paper made with a little flower and bak't between two Irons.
<hi>This is the propitiatory obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is offer'd for the Living and the
Dead.</hi> After this the <hi>Prieſt</hi> takes the <hi>Chalice,</hi> and
offers it likewiſe unto God, he makes many Prayers that God would bleſs
this <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> that he would accept it, and that it may be
gratefull and well-pleaſing to him. You muſt know, that this was the
<hi>ſacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Maſs</hi> before <pb n="172" facs="tcp:94715:98"/>
                  <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> was found out: plain Bread and wine
was then offer'd. Judge then whether any man could believe that this was a true
propitiatory Sacrifice. In this part of the <hi>Maſs</hi> every thing that
can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, is done to make this <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine</hi> to be a
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory Sacrifice: They offer it to <hi>God,</hi> they offer it to the
honour of the <hi>Saints,</hi> and of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> and ſay unto the
People, <hi>Pray to God that this Sacrifice which is yours, and mine, may be
acceptable to him.</hi> 'Tis in this part that the <hi>Secrets</hi> are ſaid,
they are ſhort Prayers ſpoken with a low voice, but are concluded with a
<hi>per omnia ſaecula ſaeculorum,</hi> which breaks forth in a voice of
Thunder after a deep ſilence.</p>
               <p>Laſtly comes the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> which
is an additional peice in favor of <hi>Tranſubstantiation.</hi> There begins
the Conſecration, and the <hi>Body</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt then comes upon
the <hi>Altar.</hi> There the <hi>Priest</hi> chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges poſtures, and makes an
hundred grimaces; he ſpeaks, and then holds his tongue, he ſtoops down,
then raiſeth himſelf up, and kiſſes the ſides of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</hi>
He makes many ſigns of the <hi>croſs:</hi> he prays for the <hi>Popes,</hi>
for <hi>Kings,</hi> and for <hi>him</hi> in particular on whoſe account that
<hi>Maſs</hi> is ſaid. He offers to the honour of <hi>God,</hi> of the
<hi>Virgin,</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs:</hi> when
the conſecration is over, he riſes up, and worſhips: After this he
proceeds to the true <hi>propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sacrifice,</hi> He offers the Body of J.
Chriſt, praying God that it may be as agreable to him as the Sacrifice of
<hi>Abel;</hi> i. e. they compare the Body of our Lord to that of a dead
Beaſt. The <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſtrikes upon his breaſt ſeveral times; he
uncovers the <hi>chalice,</hi> and makes many ſigns of the <hi>Croſs</hi>
over the Blood of J. Chriſt, to drive the Devil from it. He ſings, he
prays, and then ſets down the <hi>chalice</hi> and the conſecrated
<hi>wafers</hi> upon the <hi>corporal,</hi> that is to ſay, upon the
<hi>linnen</hi> of the <hi>Altar.</hi> He again takes up the Diſh wherin the
<hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers</hi> 
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:94715:98"/>are, he makes over himſelf a great
ſign of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and breaks the <hi>wafer</hi> into three
pieces. He throws one back into the <hi>chalice,</hi> with the other he makes
the ſigns of the <hi>croſs</hi> over the <hi>chalice,</hi> touching the
foot of it, the middle, and the brim, and then he ſtroaks his eyes with it.
He covers the <hi>chalice</hi> again, he prays, and returns to the ſide of
the People, and makes them <hi>kiſs the Pax,</hi> ſo they call a Trenchar,
or a little board on which is painted a <hi>Crucifix,</hi> or the image of the
<hi>Virgin.</hi> Then he puts himſelf in a poſture to eat the
<hi>wafer,</hi> and drink the <hi>chalice</hi> He prepares himſelf by divers
ſigns of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> kneelings, and prayers; he eats the pieces of
the <hi>wafer</hi> that are upon the plate, and then repeating the ſame
actions as for the <hi>wafer,</hi> he <hi>drinks</hi> the <hi>chalice,</hi>
with that part of the <hi>wafer</hi> that was thrown into it. He makes the
aſſiſtants likewiſe to communicate, if there be any preſent who are
prepar'd. He rinſes the gobelet with unconſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wine, he drinks it, he
empties the <hi>chalice,</hi> and folds up the <hi>linnen,</hi> and pronounces
the laſt <hi>Dominus vobiſcum;</hi> and at laſt he ſaith the <hi>Ite,
Miſſaeſt,</hi> and for a concluſion, he kiſſeth the <hi>Altar,</hi>
lifts his eyes and hands to Heaven, worſhips the <hi>croſs,</hi> and
bleſſeth the People.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the ordinary ſimple <hi>Maſſes,</hi> but
thoſe upon Great Feſtivals have the addition of many other things. For

               <p>And there is as little to be found in it that can be called
<hi>Rational.</hi> 'Tis true, in this miſcellany there are ſome things
good; for we meet with divers paſſages of the <hi>H. Scripture,</hi> but
they are intermixt without reaſon, order or coherence: and ſometimes you
may divine long enough ere you can imagine why or wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are mention'd:
Beſides that, being in an unknown tongue, whatſoever there is in it of
<hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality</hi> or <hi>Reaſon</hi> is loſt as to the People. What
reaſon is there for the Confeſſion of Sins to the <hi>Saints,</hi> and 
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:94715:99"/>to the <hi>Virgin,</hi> as well as unto God? what reaſon
is there to demand the prayers of the people, when they are ignorant of what
you ſay to 'em? Is it not abſurd and ridiculous, that a <hi>Prieſt</hi>
celebrating a private <hi>Maſs</hi> in the Corner of a <hi>Church,</hi>
without any aſſiſtants, ſhould turn himſelf about and ſpeak to the
walls, ſaying, <hi>Dominus vobiſcum. The Lord be with you?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it not ridiculous to make the <hi>Deacon</hi> aſcend an
high Pulpit, in ſight of all the People, to read to 'em an <hi>Epiſtle</hi>
or <hi>Goſpell</hi> in <hi>Latine,</hi> which they underſtand nothing of?
Is it not a manifeſt Contradiction to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer little <hi>wafers</hi> that are
not conſecrated, as a Sacrifice for the living and the dead? Is it not to
affront our Bleſſed Lord Jeſus, to pretend to arm him againſt the
Devill by making ſigns of the <hi>Croſs?</hi> Muſt they not be void of
reaſon and common ſenſe to leave a parcell of words in their
<hi>liturgie</hi> which are addreſt to the people, and yet expreſly to
order that they ſhall be pronounc't with a low voice, that they may not hear
ſo much as the ſound of 'em? To what purpoſe do they pray for all the
People, as if they were to partake of the <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine,</hi> and
yet oftentimes they do not all communicate, and when they do but in one kind,
of the <hi>bread</hi> only? In truth, we may as ſoon number the ſtars, as
reckon up all the <hi>abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, contradictions,</hi> and

               <p>What <hi>ſpirituality</hi> and what <hi>reaſon</hi> is there
in the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies added by the <hi>Papacy</hi> unto <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> the

               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:94715:100"/>
               <p>Can there be any <hi>ſpirituality</hi> or <hi>reaſon</hi> in
giving to their Devoto's a <hi>Roſary,</hi> or a ſtring of <hi>Beads,</hi>

conception of Jeſus Chriſt a thouſand times a day, two thouſand years

the greateſt part of the <hi>Gentile Gods,</hi> were men, that had been

ſervice, either to the commonwealth, or the <pb n="180" facs="tcp:94715:102"/>world,
either by the Inventing of ſome uſeful Art, or by ſome conſiderable
deliverance of his country, or by his ſingular virtues, after his death, they
made him a <hi>God.</hi> Afterward 'twas grown the faſhion at <hi>Rome</hi>
to <hi>Deify</hi> all their <hi>Emperors,</hi> good and bad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nero,</hi> that he might abuſe his own Religion, and his
Predeceſſor <hi>Claudius,</hi> got him ranked among the <hi>Gods.</hi> At
firſt the deifying of <hi>Hero's</hi> was done by the tacit conſent of the
people. But the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> (the very Patriarchs of the modern)
begun the cuſtom of making <hi>Gods</hi> in a ſolemn manner.</p>
               <p>When any of their <hi>Emperors</hi> dyed, they built in ſome
ſpacious place of the <hi>City</hi> a ſtately Funeral pile of wood, and
other combuſtible matter, divided into ſeveral ſtories, which were
faſhion'd as a <hi>Pyramid,</hi> to the poynt of which a rope was faſtned,
with which an <hi>Eagle</hi> was tyed by the foot. The dead <hi>Corps</hi> was
placed in a lower ſtorie, then the <hi>Pile</hi> was ſet on fire, and when
the rope was burnt, the <hi>Eagle</hi> flew up to the heavens, and ſome
witneſſes appointed for the thing, came and made report to the
<hi>Senate,</hi> that they had ſeen the <hi>Soul</hi> of the <hi>Hero</hi>
fly up to heaven. After this, by order of the <hi>Senate,</hi> a Temple was
built to him, and divine honours were given him. The <hi>Philoſophers,</hi>
by their fanci'es, augmented and ſupported the ſuperſtition of the
vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; they ſaid, <hi>that the Souls of men after they leave the bodie,
become a kind of Demons, or Angels, which the antients call'd</hi> Lemures;
<hi>that thoſe ſouls which were good natured, and took care of their

               <p>A man muſt in my judgment be very blind, if he

not the <hi>conformity,</hi> that is between <hi>this,</hi> and

<hi>Saints</hi> are, departed <hi>ſouls,</hi> which have been

<hi>may the ſooner come to the eternal ſabbath, and that his ſins, (which

<hi>Funeral-pile,</hi> by all who had a mind to honour the Ceremony with their

ſongs. The <hi>modern Romans</hi> have ſorrowful and mourning ſongs,
ſung by their <hi>Prieſts.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> made great uſe of

were ſprinkled; whereas now they eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſprinkle the <hi>dead:</hi>
Then it was to cleanſe the living from the pollution contracted by tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the dead; for under <hi>Paganiſin,</hi> as well as <hi>Judaiſm</hi> the
touching of a dead body was thought <pb n="183" facs="tcp:94715:103"/>to defile. <hi>S.
Jerom</hi> informs us, that the <hi>Heathens</hi> in there obſequies, made
uſe of torches and flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beau's, and thus the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do. The
<hi>Romans</hi> in kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and honour of their <hi>dead,</hi> kept a
religious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, which they call'd <hi>Novemdialia, i. e. a nine-days
feſtival:</hi> they alſo celebrated the <hi>laſt</hi> day of the month,
the <hi>fortieth</hi> day, and the <hi>anniverſary</hi> day; on all which
they offerd ſacrifices to the <hi>dij inferi,</hi> the under ground
<hi>Gods:</hi> they ſaluted the ſouls of the deceas'd, they prayed for
them, and requeſted ſuch as paſs'd by, to pray for the ſoul of the
deceaſed: they wrote on the graves <hi>bene precare, qui legis;</hi> whoever
paſſeth by, pray for him that is dead. They added, <hi>ſit tibi terra
levis, molliter' oſſa quieſcant:</hi> let the earth lie light upon you,
let your bones reſt in eaſe. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> alſo exactly
colebrate the <hi>ninth,</hi> the <hi>fortieth,</hi> the <hi>anniverſary</hi>
day, at all which times, they offer ſacrifice for the Reſt of the departed

Now, 'tis the ſecond day of <hi>November,</hi> when the feaſt of <hi>all

reproach the <hi>heathens</hi> with this, that their Temples were nothing but
the ſepulchers of dead men and women; that the Temple of <hi>Minerva</hi> of

<hi>Heathens</hi> did not own this, and were ſo far from honouring their

that was buryed there: But the <hi>Papiſts</hi> believe, that the holineſs

ſtone, of gold, of ſilver, of ivory; <hi>they have mouthes, but ſpeak
not; ears, but hear not; hands, but handle not; feet, but walk not; eyes, but
ſee not.</hi> They are likewiſe ſerv'd after the ſame manner: the

But we cannot without the worſt injuſtice, and inſincerity, charge the

that the <hi>Heathens</hi> had the ſame ſentiments of their

The wiſeſt among the <hi>Pagans,</hi> had the very ſame thoughts of their

men, who made very abaſing repreſentations of their <hi>Gods,</hi> calling
by that name, lifeleſs things, at which they would be affrighted, if they

inſpire the <hi>Papiſts</hi> with the ſame ſentiments. They give a

ſenſleſs <hi>ſtones,</hi> which if they ſhould begin to move, and
ſpeak, would ſeem much more worthy of worſhip: but in ſuch a caſe,
men would fly from them as monſters, and tremble at them as prodigious.</p>

declares, that it would not have people believe, that there is more virtue in

Antichriſtianiſm, that is found in the Papacy; a Spirit of Lying and
Fables, Falſehoods to ſuſtain the Authority of the <hi>Pope:</hi> A short

<hi>Religions</hi> in general, have the Father of Lyes for their Author. But
yet, 'tis certain, that there are ſome <hi>Sects,</hi> that are
diſtinguiſht by this, and have a Spirit of <hi>Lying</hi> for their
Character. 'Tis plain by Scripture pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, that this was to be the Spirit
of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianiſm.</hi> This is ſignified by thoſe;</p>

               <p>V. 14. <hi>For they are the Spirits of Devils, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

               </p>
               <p>Theſe Spirits of Devils, are thoſe <hi>Lying Spirits,</hi>
who by <hi>Fables,</hi> and falſe <hi>Miracles,</hi> deceive the Inhabitants
of the Earth. 'Tis of the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Lying and Impoſture, that this
Prophecy ſpeaks;</p>
               <p>V. 13. <hi>And he doth great Wonders,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo that he maketh Fire come down from

               </p>
               <p>V. 14. <hi>And deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth, by means
of thoſe Miracles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Wonders are Lying Miracles, Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Impoſtures,
or Fables. This is alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted <pb n="194" facs="tcp:94715:109"/>by St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> in his 2. Epiſt. to the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. 9. <hi>— Whoſe coming</hi> (viz. of <hi>the Myſtery
of Iniquity) is after the working of Satan, with all Power and Signs, and Lying
Wonders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But above all, this is the Character, that the ſame
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> expreſly giveth the curſed Authors of the
<hi>Antichriſtian Apoſtacy;</hi> telling us, that the Worſhip of Demons,
and Spirits, as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, was to be ſet on foot by</p>
               <p>V. 2. <hi>Men,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The true Spirit of <hi>Popery,</hi> is lying Fables and
Impoſture, and conſequently it is <hi>Antichriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm.</hi> Let none
wonder, that we detain the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> longer than uſual on his Point.
For there is not a more ſenſible and palpable evidence, that the
<hi>Papacy</hi> oweth its Original to the Devil, than this. All falſe
<hi>Religions</hi> have their fabulous <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; Paganiſm</hi> had its
<hi>Fables;</hi> corrupted <hi>Judaiſm</hi> had theirs. But all the
<hi>Fables</hi> of all the falſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions put together, do not come near
thoſe of <hi>Popery,</hi> either for number or horridneſs. And thoſe who
will not ſee its Falſehood and Vanity by this proſpect, will never
diſcern it by any other. I promiſe once again, that I do not call
<hi>Popery,</hi> that which remains of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in the <hi>Roman
Church,</hi> for inſtance, the Divinity of Chriſt, his Reſurrection, his
Redemtion, and Judging the World, &amp;c.</p>

little or no eare to preſerve any part of it. Or rather, 
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:94715:109"/>God hath not permitted, that his holy Myſtery ſhould

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Journey and Death of St.
<hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> are not very certain. 'Tis true, antient
Authors have ſaid ſo. But it doth not in the leaſt agree with the
Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or with the
Chronology of St. <hi>Paul's Epiſtles.</hi> That <hi>Apoſtle</hi> made two
Journeys to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was twice a Priſoner. In his ſecond
Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, they will have him ſuffer Martyrdom with St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
'Tis very ſurpriſing and aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, that the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi>
(who in his <hi>Epiſtles</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at <hi>Rome,</hi> mentioneth ſo many
perſons of a mean quality) ſhould ſay nothing of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> The
Myſtery of Iniquity began to work in Saint <hi>Paul's</hi> time; this
Journey, and Martyrdom of St. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> (whether true or
falſe) was to be the principal foundation of the vain pretences of this
Counterfeit <hi>Monarch</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> 'Tis not improbable, that
this Spirit of Lying, which ſowed the firſt ſeeds of
<hi>Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Antients of the
<hi>ſecond</hi> Century, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> had appointed the <hi>Bishop
of Rome</hi> to be his <hi>Succeſsor;</hi> tho this was plainly falſe. For
St. <hi>Peter</hi> had the charge of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and of the Church of
the <hi>Circumciſion.</hi> Now the <hi>Jews</hi> were very inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
at <hi>Rome,</hi> where they had no more reſpect than thoſe
Fortune-tellers, whom we call <hi>Gypſies</hi> have among us. The greateſt,
and moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of the <hi>Jews</hi> were about
<hi>Babylon;</hi> and 'tis there that St. <hi>Peter</hi> dates his <hi>firſt
Epiſtle.</hi> As to the pretended <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> of St. <hi>Peter</hi>
at <hi>Rome,</hi> which laſted <hi>five and twenty</hi> years. 'Tis a
<hi>Fable,</hi> whoſe Original is found to be in the <hi>fourth</hi> Century,
in Sr. <hi>Jerom's</hi> time, who is the eldeſt Author who mentioneth it. For
it is only to be found in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom's</hi> verſion of the <hi>Chronicle</hi>
of <hi>Euſebius.</hi> This <hi>Falle</hi> is unanſwerably refuted, both by
the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <pb n="197" facs="tcp:94715:110"/>of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and by
<hi>Chronology.</hi> And (as one Fable produceth another) the long abode of St.
<hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> hath produceth the <hi>Fable</hi> of his
Conteſt with <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Magician,</hi> in which this Magician
flying in the Air out of ſight, St. <hi>Peters</hi> prayers tumbled him down,
and broke his Leggs: or rather this laſt Fable was the older, and ſo
produced the other. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Fiction of St. <hi>Peter's</hi> long
abode at <hi>Rome,</hi> was not ſufficient to found the Dominion of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> they have forg'd <hi>Decretal Epiſtles</hi> of the firſt
<hi>Popes,</hi> from S. <hi>Clement,</hi> Peter's <hi>Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.</hi> In
which <hi>Epiſtles</hi> theſe firſt Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> aſcribe
to themſelves all that Authority which the <hi>Popes</hi> have ſince
uſurped. They have beſides forged a counterfeit <hi>Donation</hi> of
<hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> by which he gives away to Pope <hi>Sylveſter,</hi>
and his Succeſſors the <hi>Popes,</hi> the City of <hi>Rome, Italie,</hi>
the <hi>Weſtern Kingdoms,</hi> and almoſt the whole <hi>Roman Empire.</hi>
And that this Title might be ſupported by poſſeſſion, the fabulous
Hiſtory of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> maketh the firſt Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi>
(by virtue of their <hi>Papal</hi> Authority) to ſend <hi>Bishops</hi> into
every Countrey, to plant <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> there. Thus St.

<hi>Paris; Gratian</hi> to <hi>Tours; Julian</hi> to <hi>Mentz; St.

Biſhops. This is but a ſmall part of the <hi>Romance</hi> of the
<hi>Papal</hi> Authority, but becauſe we muſt proceed to ſeveral other
Inſtances, we cannot inſiſt longer upon this.</p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:94715:111"/>
               <p>'Tis certain,<note place="margin">The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the V.
<hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </note> that in all <hi>Popery</hi> there is nothing ſo
ſingular, and ſo near to that <hi>Worship,</hi> which is 0165 0 given to
God, as the Worship of the <hi>Virgin.</hi> 'Tis not eaſy to carry
<hi>Idolatry</hi> to a higher degree, as we have before demonſtrated. And we
may truly ſay, there never was a larger and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable
<hi>Romance</hi> than the <hi>Hiſtory of the Virgin,</hi> framed on purpoſe
to eſtabliſh the <hi>Adoration</hi> of the Mother of Jeſus Chriſt. This
Adoration is grounded on the glorious Priviledges which ſhe received from
God, in her Conception, in her Birth, in her Life, in her Death, in her
Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, in her Aſſumtion, and in her Miracles. We muſt give you
an Epitome of this fabulous Hiſtory; and this <hi>Romance</hi> of the
<hi>Virgin,</hi> is far leſs diſcreet, than that of <hi>St. Roſe</hi>
mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>'Tis probable, that the Holy Ghoſt hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly been
ſilent about the Life and Death of the bleſſed <hi>Virgin.</hi> Perhaps,
he intended by this ſilence to prevent the horrid <hi>Superſtition,</hi>
which would flow from the Honour that is due to this holy <hi>Woman.</hi> If
this was the deſign, it hath ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded but ill. For men have by their
Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures diſcovered all the Circumſtances of the Life of this
<hi>Saint.</hi> By one means or other (God knows how) they know them all, as
certainly as if <hi>She</hi> had always had an <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> or
<hi>Annaliſt</hi> by her ſide, who kept a diary of all that befel her, even
before ſhe was born. <hi>Firſt,</hi> they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, (I know not
from whom) that her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Name was <hi>Joachim,</hi> her Mothers
<hi>Anna.</hi> That <hi>Anna</hi> had two Siſters, and that all three were
Daughters of <hi>Matthan</hi> the High Prieſt, that ſo the Royal and
Sacerdotal Blood might be joyn'd in the perſon of <hi>Mary.</hi> This was
known <pb n="199" facs="tcp:94715:111"/>in the <hi>fourth</hi> Century, in the time of
<hi>St. Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi> But in the <hi>eighth</hi> Century,<note place="margin">Miracles in the Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Birth, and Infancy of the V.
<hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </note> men were told by a new Revelation, that <hi>Joachim</hi>
was the Son of <hi>Barpanther,</hi> and he the Son of <hi>Panther.</hi> Theſe
Names are not to be found in any of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Genealogies; but that
is no matter. <hi>Anna</hi> the Mother of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> and Wife of
<hi>Joachim,</hi> was a long time barren: The High Prieſt
<hi>Iſſachar</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the Offerings of <hi>Joachim,</hi> as being a
Dry Tree, an uſeleſs Member of the Common-wealth, becauſe he could not
perform the work of Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication. <hi>Joachim</hi> filled with ſhame,
would not return home; <hi>Anna</hi> ſorely troubled, that the Reproach of
her Barreneſs, had deprived her of her Husband, doubleth her Prayers and
Tears; <hi>Joachim,</hi> afflicted with her Sorrow, hideth himſelf in a
Deſert, where after forty Dayes retirement, an Angel finds him out, and
bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him return to his Wiſe; <hi>Anna</hi> the mean while had retired
alone, into the <hi>Sanctum San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum,</hi> (whither never any Man or Woman
could come, excepting the <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> who went there once a year.)
In this place an <hi>Angel</hi> appeareth to <hi>Anna,</hi> and tells her of
the future Birth of <hi>Mary.</hi> Behold how the <hi>Virgin</hi> is already as
highly honour'd, as her <hi>Son:</hi> for an <hi>Angel</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to fore-tel
her Birth, before ſhe was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. After this <hi>Anna</hi> is with Child
in a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous manner; for ſhe was naturally barren, and was now too old to
bear Children. Beſides, the Conception of the little <hi>Mary</hi> was
<hi>immaculate,</hi> as well as that of her Son <hi>Jeſus;</hi> ſhe was
alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived without Original Sin. Indeed, this diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very was not very
certain for the ſixteen hundred years paſt; but in this <hi>laſt</hi>
Age, after innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Violent and bitter Conteſts between the
<hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcans</hi> 
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:94715:112"/>and <hi>Dominicans,</hi> the
former being aſſiſted by the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> have confirmed the Truth
of the <hi>Immaculate Conception.</hi> All the beſt Antiquity knew nothing of
it; the <hi>Fathers</hi> have expreſly contradicted it. But <hi>Salmeron</hi>
the <hi>Jeſuite</hi> hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that all the <hi>Fathers,</hi> in this
point, are meer Fools and Blockheads, and that men owe them no
ſubmiſſion, but only when they plead for the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi>
againſt the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> then they are Infallible. To confirm this
<hi>Fable</hi> of the <hi>Immaculate Conception,</hi> they have not fail'd to
frame others. S. <hi>Bridget</hi> had ſeveral Revelations about it, and the
<hi>Virgin</hi> herſelf often aſſured her of her own <hi>Immaculate
Conception.</hi> To oppoſe this Truth, the <hi>Dominicans</hi> of
<hi>Bern,</hi> in the year 1507. wrought that famous <hi>Miracle,</hi> which is
related by all our Hiſtorians, which Hiſtory Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> hath very
lately rectified in the <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of his <hi>Travels.</hi> Without
doubt the <hi>Virgin</hi> being provokt, that they ſhould by falſe Miracles
oppoſe her Glorious <hi>Conception,</hi> ſuffered the Cheat to be
diſcovered. <hi>Four</hi> principal Actors of this <hi>Comedie,</hi> were
taken and burnt, as Victims to the <hi>Virgin</hi> and her good Friends the
<hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> in a <hi>Medow</hi> that was over againſt, and in
view of their <hi>Convent,</hi> that thoſe good <hi>Fathers</hi> might feed
their Eyes with the ſight of this juſt Puniſhment of the Enemies of their
<hi>Goddeſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Virgin</hi> being thus miraculouſly conceiv'd, and
with a Priviledge equal to that of her <hi>Son,</hi> came into the World the
<hi>eighth of September,</hi> at ſuch an hour: For without doubt, there was
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſome devout Woman, who obſerved the Birth-day of the <hi>Queen
of Heaven;</hi> nay further, they know the very Houſe, where ſhe was born;
it was ſcituated in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> very near to the 
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:94715:112"/>
                  <hi>Pool by the Sheep-market.</hi> This the great
<hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> hath told us, who was honour'd with this
<hi>Revelation</hi> very likely, for his great zeal for the Adoration of the
Virgin's <hi>Images;</hi> there were not leſs <hi>Miracles,</hi> nor leſs
Alterations in Heaven and Earth, at the Birth of the <hi>Mother,</hi> than
there were afterward at the Birth of the Son. <hi>For whole Troops of Angels
came down from Heaven, and ſung Hymns, and melodious Songs, in Honour of the
newly born Spouſe of the Eternal King. And the Holy little Girle, which as
ſoon as She was born, had the uſe of her Reaſon, was wonderfully
pleaſed and rejoyced to hear them. And which is ſtill more ſtrange, this
Melody of the Angelick Choir, was every year repeated on the ſame day.</hi>
'Tis a Saint, <hi>St. Bernardin de Buſtis,</hi> who tells us this, and
conſequently we cannot doubt of it. At the Birth of the <hi>Son,</hi> there
was the apparition of a <hi>New Star</hi> in the Air; but there was a great
deal more at the Birth of the <hi>Mother.</hi> The Light of the <hi>Sun</hi>
was doubled for a day and a night; that of the <hi>Moon</hi> was ſo
augmented, that it was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be the <hi>Sun;</hi> and more than all this,
cloſe to the Body of the <hi>Moon,</hi> there appeared a great <hi>Star,</hi>
of an extraordinary clearneſs and ſplendor. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> an
<hi>Angel</hi> gave the little <hi>Girle</hi> her Name, and call'd her
<hi>Mirjam,</hi> which ſignifieth, <hi>The Star of the Sea</hi> (as the
<hi>Monks</hi> explain it, who are very skilful in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and
<hi>Rabbinical</hi> Language.) Becauſe <hi>Mary</hi> was to ſucceed
<hi>Venus,</hi> who was begotten of the <hi>Scum</hi> of the Sea, and the Seed
of <hi>Caelus.</hi> The <hi>Mother</hi> of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is at this
day the <hi>Chriſtians Venus,</hi> the Morning-Star, which guides them thro
all Dangers, to conduct and pilote them to the Haven of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anna,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Mary,</hi> to obtain this 
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:94715:113"/>Child, had vowed to give her to God, even as <hi>Anna,
Samuels</hi> Mother, had vowed to give him. To perform this Vow, <hi>Anna</hi>
the Wife of <hi>Joachim,</hi> preſented her <hi>Daughter,</hi> when three
years old, to the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> for the ſervice of the <hi>Temple.</hi>
'Twas very wiſely contrived, to conſecrate a Girle to the ſervice of the
Temple, into which no Woman might ſo much as enter, (there being an outward
<hi>Court,</hi> which was appropriated to that Sex.) Neverthleſs the
<hi>Prieſts</hi> received <hi>her,</hi> and put her into the <hi>Holy of
Holies,</hi> to keep the <hi>Cherubims</hi> company. There ſhe was fed eleven
years by <hi>Angels.</hi> After eleven years, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> held a
Conſultation, to know what they ſhould do with this <hi>Holy Virgin;</hi>
the concluſion was, that they ſhould commit her to the keeping of
<hi>Joſeph,</hi> who had given great evidences of his Virtue and Continence.
It had been far more ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, to have committed her to ſome venerable
<hi>Matrons</hi> to keep. But the Authors of this <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi> did not
judge this expedient, becauſe of ſomething that was to follow upon this.
She was <hi>fourteen years old,</hi> when she was committed to the cuſtody of
that good old man <hi>Joſeph:</hi> ſhe was hanſome, and had every thing
that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to inflame Love; But the good Man went no further than as her
Guardian to inſpect and watch over her.</p>
               <p>Three Months after this, when ſhe was in the firſt quarter
of her <hi>fifteenth</hi> year, ſhe was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd with the Salutation of the
<hi>Angel,</hi> and with Marriage to the <hi>third</hi> Perſon of the
adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Trinity.</hi> It would have ſeem'd more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for them to
have made the <hi>Mother</hi> of our Lord to be of riper years, as to her Body,
but eſpecially as to her mind, that ſhe might be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable 
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:94715:113"/>to reflect with more attention and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the
<hi>Miracle</hi> which was wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her.<note place="margin">The Virgin was
but 15. years old when She ceiv'd by the Holy Ghoſt.</note> But the
<hi>Legendaries</hi> are wiſer than we, and knew doubtleſs by Revelation,
that the Heavenly <hi>Bridegroom</hi> had moſt mind to young and growing
Beauties. She then becomes a <hi>Mother</hi> at fifteen years old. And by
reaſon of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle</hi> which God had wrought in her Womb, ſhe was
obliged to live with <hi>Joſeph</hi> under the name of his <hi>Spouſe,</hi>
to maintain her reputation among thoſe who were ignorant of this
<hi>Myſtery.</hi> It is not certain whether the <hi>Prieſts</hi> knew all
this, who committed her to the Cuſtody of <hi>Joſeph:</hi> if they knew not
that ſhe had conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, they had no great reaſon to be
well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who had been no more careful to
preſerve the Virginity of the Damſel put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Tuition and Care. They
who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative as well as devout, are extreamly puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to know how
this Miraculous Conception was made, and of what matter <hi>Jeſus</hi> was
form'd; for they think it not becoming the Majeſty of the Lord
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> that he ſhould be formed of that Blood, that which falls
into the parts appointed for Conception. Therefore they very piouſly tell us,
that the Holy Ghoſt took out Three Drops of <hi>Blood</hi> from the Heart of
<hi>Mary,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyd'em into the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus,</hi> from thence to frame
the body of our <hi>Saviour.</hi> They who are not of this opinion, yet
confeſs, that 'tis a very devout and pious Contemplation.</p>
               <p>When the B. <hi>Virgin</hi> had brought forth the
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer</hi> into the world, and the rumor began to ſpread, that it was
by the Holy Ghoſt that She had conceiv'd, and that She was delivered of a
<hi>Son</hi> without blemiſhing the Marks of her <hi>Virginity,</hi> 
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:94715:114"/>there were multitudes who would not give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to it.
And as we read of a <hi>Thomas,</hi> who would ſee, and put his Finger into
the Side of Chriſt, to be the better aſſured of his Reſurrection, ſo
there was a certain Woman, named <hi>Salome,</hi> who would ſee, and feel,
and ſearch the <hi>Virgin-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> with ſuch Circumſtances as would
cauſe the moſt impudent of Women to bluſh, and yet the
<hi>Protoevangelium,</hi> attributed to St. <hi>James,</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the
whole Story at length.</p>
               <p>The reſt of the Life of <hi>Mary</hi> is wrote after the
ſame ſtrain, and with the like degree of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty; but that I may not
enlarge too much, I paſs it over, and come to her Death and Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is the principal thing in this piece,<note place="margin">The Fable of the
Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the Virgin.</note> becauſe 'tis on that eſpecially they
would ground her advancement to the Right Hand of God, and the Divine Honours
which are given to her. Let us ſee then after what manner She dyed:
<hi>Mary</hi> had lived to the Age of 58. <hi>years,</hi> others ſay 63. and
others make it more. 'Tis very ſtrange, that knowing ſo exactly, as they
pretend, all the reſt of her Life, that they ſhould be no better informed
concerning the length of it: but the reaſon is, becauſe it is a matter of
no great moment as to their deſign. The Holy <hi>Virgin</hi> being weary of
living, earneſtly intreats her <hi>Son</hi> to take her out of this World.
<hi>Ieſus</hi> ſends an <hi>Angel</hi> to her, with the promiſe and
aſſurance, that within three days it ſhould be done as She deſired. The
<hi>Angel</hi> brought her a Branch of a <hi>Palm-tree</hi> from Paradiſe,
and bid her take care that this Branch be carried upon her Biere at her Burial:
He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe gave her Mourning Garments, that She might dye in a ſuitable
and becoming Habit, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Age, and wear Mourning for her 
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:94715:114"/>ſelf. <hi>Mary</hi> deſires two things of her
<hi>Son</hi> by the Mediation of the <hi>Angel: Firſt,</hi> that She might be
buried by all the <hi>Apoſtles. Secondly,</hi> that her <hi>Soul</hi> might
ſee no <hi>Demon,</hi> when it left her Body. The <hi>Angel</hi> returns, and
leaves the Branch of <hi>Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,</hi> which immediately became glittering
and glorious, every of its leaves ſhin'd like the Morning-Star. The
<hi>Virgin</hi> full of joy, aſſembles the Holy <hi>Women</hi> together,
who were wont to viſit her, and gives them an account of her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Death. St. <hi>Iohn</hi> was at this time prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching at <hi>Epheſus;</hi> in
the midſt of his Sermon a noiſe of Thunder is heard, and a Bright Cloud
takes him up, and carries him thro the air to the very door of <hi>Mary's</hi>
Houſe. He goes in; the <hi>Virgin</hi> and this <hi>Apoſtle</hi> embrace
one another with abundance of Tears; he is informed by <hi>Mary,</hi> that
within three days She ſhould dye. All the other <hi>Apoſtles</hi> arriv'd
ſoon after, in the ſame manner carried thro the Air. They were ſtrangely
ſurpriſed, and aſtoniſht to find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in that place; St.
<hi>Iohn</hi> unfolds the Myſtery, they came in, they wept ſorely, and
adored the H. <hi>Virgin.</hi> After a great deal of Worſhip, and much
diſcourſe, <hi>Mary</hi> received the Communion, recommended her Soul to
her <hi>Son,</hi> fell upon her knees, and put herſelf in a poſture and
prepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to dye. About the third hour of the day, i. e. about nine a
clock in the forenoon, <hi>Ieſus</hi> with the <hi>nine</hi> Orders of the
<hi>Angels,</hi> and the Aſſembly of the <hi>Patriarchs, Prophets, Martyrs,
Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,</hi> &amp;c. i. e. with all the Court of Heaven, came and
ſtood round about his <hi>Mother's</hi> Bed. He and all the Celeſtial
Company ſung a melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Song, which began thus; <hi>Come mine Elect, and I
will ſet Thee upon my Throne, &amp;c.</hi> The <pb n="206" facs="tcp:94715:115"/>
                  <hi>Virgin</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>Behold, I come; for in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of thy Book it is written of me, that I should do thy will O God!</hi> And with
theſe words She gave up the Ghoſt. When the Soul was departed, the Body
ſpake of it ſelf, ſaying, <hi>I thank thee Lord, that I am thy Glory,
remember me, becauſe I am thy Workmanship, and have kept that which thou
haſt intruſted with me.</hi> The dead Body, which nevertheleſs could
ſpeak, became ſo bright and luminous, that the <hi>Virgins</hi> who waſht
it, tho they might touch it, were not able to look upon it.</p>
               <p>When the Body was to be carried to the ground, the
<hi>Apoſtles</hi> made many Complements and Civilities to one another,
concerning the places of honour in the Ceremony; for they were not it ſeems,
of the humour of the <hi>Monks,</hi> who at the like meetings do oftentimes
quarrel who ſhall go firſt, ſo as to knock one another with the
Croſier-Staff.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> carried the Body, and
<hi>Iohn</hi> the Palm-branch before the <hi>Biere,</hi> the other
<hi>Apoſtles</hi> followed. As they were marching along in due order and
Ceremony, <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> covered with a Cloud, with all his Angels,
overtakes 'em, and joyning their Voices to thoſe of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi>
they ſung the <hi>Obits</hi> in honour of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> with a
raviſhing Melody; and at the ſame time the whole Air round about was
perfumed with a moſt grateful Odour. The furious <hi>Iews</hi> being enraged
at this ſpectacle, thought it a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per occaſion to rid their hands of
all the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> at once. The <hi>High Prieſt</hi> with both his
hands laid hold on the <hi>Biere,</hi> to ſtop it, but both were immediately
wither'd and dryed up, and fell off from his Arms at the Wreſts; the
Remainder of <pb n="207" facs="tcp:94715:115"/>the Enemies Troop was ſtruck with
Blindneſs. The miſerable <hi>High Prieſt</hi> of the <hi>Iews</hi> made a
grievous Out-cry for the loſs of his two Hands. <hi>Peter</hi> tells him,
there was no cure for him on any other terms than theſe, that he devoutly
kiſs the Biere of <hi>Mary,</hi> and immediately turn <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
He did ſo, and was healed preſently. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo gave him one of
the <hi>Dates,</hi> that grew on the Branch of <hi>Palm,</hi> therewith to
ſtroke the Eyes of thoſe who were ſtruck with Blindneſs; and by ſo
doing, all that numerous Company reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their ſight. After this, the
Convoy of the <hi>Virgin's Body</hi> performed their journey without any Let or
Moleſtation, even to the Valley of <hi>Iehoſaphat,</hi> where they laid the
Corps of the <hi>Mother of God</hi> in a new Sepulcher, hewn out of a Rock, as
that wherein the Body of the Lord Jeſus was laid. When they had thus interred
the Corps, they remain by it three days, which they ſpent in prayers. At the
end of three days, a bright cloud encompaſſeth the <hi>Sepulcher,</hi>
An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical voices are heard round about it, and a ſweet Odour perfumes the
place; <hi>Ieſus</hi> deſcends from heaven, ſalutes the
<hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and ſpeaks to them after this manner, <hi>Peace be unto
you; what kind of Honour and Glory, think you, do I owe to my Mother?</hi> To
which they replied, <hi>It ſeems juſt, O Lord, to thy Servants, that as
after having conquered Death, thou reigneſt for ever and ever, in like
manner, that thou raiſe the Body of thy Mother, and cauſe it to ſit down
for ever at thy Right-hand.</hi> Thereupon the Soul of <hi>Mary</hi>
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately appeared, and the Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſaid unto it,
<hi>Ariſe my Well Beloved, left up the Tabernacle of Glory, the Veſſel of
Life; Thou art fair my dearly Beloved, and there is no Spot in thee; as 
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:94715:116"/>thou hadſt no Spot, ſo thy body shall not ſee
Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> At theſe words the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Virgin</hi>
aroſe, and was united again to her Soul, and aſcended to Heaven with her
<hi>Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold after what manner the whole buſineſs was
tranſacted, according to the Relation of <hi>Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bart de Temeſwar,</hi> a
ſober and grave Author, whoſe Honeſty and Credit is canoniſed afreſh
by Father <hi>Craſſet,</hi> within theſe eight or ten <hi>years:</hi> So
that we have no reaſon to doubt of his Teſtimony, or ſuſpect his
Authority. Not but that there are many who do not believe him, eſpecially in
<hi>France,</hi> but of ſuch we may ſay, that they are not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough-pac'd
<hi>Catholicks.</hi> The <hi>Sermon</hi> concerning the <hi>Aſſumption</hi>
of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> was left out of the Service of the day by the
<hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> Anno 1668. which

               <p>ONe would think, that the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of any perſon

otherwiſe in regard of the B. <hi>Virgin.</hi> She hath done many more
conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable things ſince her Death, than ere ſhe did in her Life time.
So that the continuation of her Hiſtory, if we ſhould be exact and
particular in <pb n="209" facs="tcp:94715:116"/>our account of it, would be much larger
than that which hath already been related of her. But I muſt contract it, and
content my ſelf to take notice of ſome paſſages only, eſpecially
ſuch as have ſerved to lay the Foundation of the moſt famous Houſes of
Devotion of the <hi>Mother</hi> of God. The Hiſtory of the Foundation of our
<hi>Lady</hi>'s Church at <hi>Montferrat</hi> is very remarkable.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Fabulous Hiſtory of the founding our Lady's
Church of <hi>Montferrat.</hi>
                  </note>The firſt <hi>Count of Barcelona</hi>
had a <hi>Daughter,</hi> who was beautiful to a wonder, but poſſeſſed
by the <hi>Devil.</hi> The <hi>Count</hi> brings her to an holy Man, named
<hi>Iohn Guerin,</hi> to be diſpoſſeſt, that he might <hi>exorcize</hi>
the <hi>Devil.</hi> 'Twas neceſſary She ſhould tarry ſome days with
this Brother; that the Ceremony might be duly performed; The <hi>Devil</hi>
goes out of the Body of the <hi>Princeſs,</hi> but enters into the heart of
the <hi>Monk.</hi> This <hi>Monk</hi> falls in love with the
<hi>Princeſs,</hi> raviſhes her, and then Murders her to conceal his Crime.
This <hi>Brother</hi> recovers from his violent paſſion, is ſenſible of
the hainous Nature of his Offence, makes a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Rome,</hi>
confeſſes his Sin to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and demands of him what Penance he
ſhould think fit. The <hi>Pope</hi> appoints him to return to
<hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi> but to creep thither upon all four like a Beaſt, and
not to lift himſelf up, till a Child of three Moneths old ſhould command
him to riſe, and by that he ſhould be certified, that God had forgiven him.
Brother <hi>Guerin</hi> led that Brutiſh ſort of life for ſeven years; at
the end of which time the <hi>Count of Barcelona,</hi> as he was hunting, found
this man in a Cave, where he appeared hairy like a Bear. He took him, and
cauſed him to be brought home, and tyed up in the Stable as a Monſter: it
happen'd that the <hi>Count</hi> having a great Entertainment at his Houſe,
upon the Birth <pb n="210" facs="tcp:94715:117"/>of a Child of his Family, had a mind to
divert the Company with the ſight of this <hi>Animal,</hi> whereof he neither
knew the name, nor the ſpecies. He is brought into the <hi>Hall,</hi> and the
<hi>Infant,</hi> whoſe Birth gave occaſion to that Feaſt, being
preſent, ſpoke theſe words to him, with an audible and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct voice,
(to the amazement of the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, you may well imagin) <hi>Ariſe, and
ſtand upon thy Feet, Brother</hi> John Guerin, <hi>for God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given thy
Sins.</hi> The man recovers himſelf, and gets on his Cloaths, and relates the
particulars of his own Hiſtory. The <hi>Count</hi> pardons him, but is
importunate to know what was become of the Body of his <hi>Daughter. Iohn
Guerin</hi> conducts ſome of the <hi>Counts</hi> people to the place where
was the body: there they find the <hi>young Lady</hi> alive, as freſh and
beautiful as ever. You muſt know, that ſhe had devoted her ſelf to the
<hi>Virgin,</hi> who had thus miraculouſly preſerv'd her. They thereupon
build a <hi>Convent</hi> upon the place; the <hi>Princeſs</hi> was made
<hi>Abbeſs,</hi> and Brother <hi>Iohn Guerin</hi> Confeſſor of this new
<hi>Convent.</hi> Near this place they find an <hi>Image</hi> of the
<hi>Virgin,</hi> ſhining with a glorious light, and perfum'd with ſweet
Odours. A troop of Angels ſerv'd this <hi>Image,</hi> and ſung round about
it divers Songs and Hymns with an admirable Melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. An Attempt was made to
remove the <hi>Image,</hi> but it became ſo heavy, that it was impoſſible
to ſtir it from the place. They then build a <hi>Chappel</hi> over the
Cavern, and this is the original of that famous <hi>Chappel</hi> of
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> where the <hi>Virgin</hi> hath ſince wrought ſo many

they made a <hi>Chappel</hi> of it, and there celebrated the Divine

was a Painter, as well as a Phyſician, drew the <hi>Picture</hi> of our

very fruitful of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> continued there above twelve hundred

                  <hi>Wars,</hi> were wont to viſit it with a great deal of Devotion

out of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> the <hi>Chappel</hi> weary and diſcontented to
ſee it ſelf leſs honoured and frequented than formerly, thought good that
the <hi>Angels</hi> ſhould tranſport it from thence into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi>
about twelve or fifteen hundred Leagues from <hi>Nazareth.</hi> Never any
Building made ſuch a leap. They plac't it there upon a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain near the
Town <hi>Terſanctum.</hi> Multitudes come thither with great Devotion,
inſomuch that our <hi>Lady</hi> was very ſenſible of the change. But this
did not laſt long, the Peoples Devotion cool'd and declin'd again, which
oblig'd the <hi>Virgin</hi> to give a new Commiſſion to the
<hi>Angels,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move her Houſe into <hi>Italy,</hi> to a place called
<hi>Reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati,</hi> ſcituate in the midſt of a Wood, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to a
Lady nam'd <hi>Loreta.</hi> This <hi>ſecond</hi> Tranſlation gave new life
to the Peoples Zeal, and they flockt thither from all parts. But they who got
the moſt by it, were a Company of Thieves, who without any reſpect to the
Houſe of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> made no ſcruple to rob the <hi>Pilgrims,</hi>
who reſorted thither, and ſhelter themſelves in the Wood. To remedy this
Miſchief, the <hi>Angels</hi> give another lift to this miraculous Houſe,
and ſettle it upon a <hi>Mountain,</hi> not far off. This Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain belonged
to two <hi>Brothers,</hi> who gain'd prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly by the great concourſe

that the <hi>Virgin</hi> commanded the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> to tranſport her
<hi>Houſe</hi> once more, which was the <hi>fourth</hi> time. They did ſo,
and carried it along the high way of <hi>Recanati,</hi> where ſhe hath
thought it fit to ſtop ever ſince, and take a little reſt after ſo many
violent motions in removing. <pb n="213" facs="tcp:94715:118"/>And 'tis very probable, that
it will never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from thence; for ſince the time of <hi>Luther</hi>
and <hi>Calvin,</hi> the <hi>Angels</hi> are not ſo forward as heretofore, to
work ſuch kind of Miracles in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of <hi>Mary.</hi> That you may not
imagin this to be a <hi>Fable,</hi> you muſt know, that the people of
<hi>Reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati,</hi> who were ignorant whence this wonderful Houſe ſhould
come, were duely informed of the truth of all theſe <hi>Miracles</hi> by a
devout perſon, whom the <hi>Virgin</hi> obliged with a particular Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the whole matter, that the B. <hi>Virgin</hi> might not fail of being
devoutly worſhipt in this place. But becauſe the people were incredulous,
and had not faith enough to credit the ſtory of the old man, they ſent
ſixteen <hi>Ambaſſadors,</hi> grave pious and credible perſons, from
<hi>Recanati</hi> to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> with the exact meaſures of the

found an <hi>Inſcription,</hi> which certified that there had been ſuch a

<hi>Hiſtory?</hi> eſpecially ſince it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven on Tables of Braſs,
which are hung up in the <hi>Houſe</hi> it ſelf. The Jeſuite
<hi>Turſellin</hi> hath related the whole <hi>Hiſtory</hi> in very good
<hi>Latin,</hi> and adorned it with many curious Circumſtances, which for the
ſake of brevity we omit, and hath inlarged it by the account of very many
Miracles wrought by the <hi>Virgin</hi> in favor of her <hi>Houſe</hi> and
<hi>Image.</hi> The whole confirmed by the Priviledge and Approbation of Pope
<hi>Clement</hi> VIII. and fortified with the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the graveſt
<hi>Authors</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, <pb n="214" facs="tcp:94715:119"/>ſuch as
<hi>Rainaldus, Bzovius,</hi> and <hi>Spondanus,</hi> who have not forgot to

exactneſs and fidelity, that none can be ſuppoſed to queſtion his
Authority in <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpecially in the Neighbourhood of

ridiculous, abſurd, and ſilly, impoſed upon the world? the

debaucht by a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and Privately left the <hi>Convent,</hi> and
for fifteen years frequented the Stews, and the moſt infamous places; during

obſerved that ſhe was abſent. Inſomuch that at her return, ſhe
reaſſum'd her former Offices and Imploy without the leaſt ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh to

Commiſſion to two Angels to tranſport the <hi>Abbeſs</hi> unto a

               </p>
               <p>To what purpoſe is all this? 'tis to perſuade the World,

                  <note place="margin">The deſign of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendaries is to

that there is no danger from which the <hi>Virgin</hi> doth not deliver thoſe
who devoutly worſhip her, and give her the preference to all others. Father
<hi>Craſſet</hi> hath lately made an whole book to that purpoſe, and
therein he affirms, that there is no man ſo wicked, &amp; ſo much
accurſed of God, that can want the Mercy of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> provided
that he be truly devout towards her, he quotes the words of
<hi>Bonaventure,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>O Mary, how wretched and miſerable

               <p>'Tis with the intent to perſwade to, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote theſe
impieties, that Father <hi>Craſſet</hi> hath heapt together innumerable
Examples of ſuch as have been ſaved by the <hi>Virgin,</hi> tho they were
the vileſt of men, and Monſters of Wickedneſs. Such is that of one
<hi>Theophilus</hi> of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> who had given himſelf to the
<hi>Devil,</hi> by means of a <hi>Jew,</hi> who was a Magician; but by the help
of the <hi>Virgin</hi> was delivered: ſuch again is the Example of a young
<hi>Soldier</hi> of <hi>Gaſcony,</hi> who having given himſelf to the
<hi>Devil,</hi> denied <hi>God</hi> and <hi>J. Chriſt,</hi> but would never
renounce or diſown the <hi>Virgin,</hi> tho the Devil very earneſtly
preſt him to it, and this ſaved him; for the <hi>Virgin</hi> undertook his
cauſe, and carried it againſt the Father and the Son. And that Woman who
prayed to the <hi>Virgin</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found her Neighbour who had tempted away
her husband from her, the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Virgin</hi> replied to the
Woman, and told her, <hi>She of whom thou ſpeakeſt is wont to offer me very
acceptable Praiſes and Worship; I cannot do any thing for her
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</hi> The ſame Authors tell us, the <hi>Virgin</hi> hath often
delivered her <hi>Votaries</hi> from the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, in Storms at Sea, out of the
grave, and out of Hell it ſelf, to give them time to confeſs themſelves,
that they may be ſaved; only becauſe they had been careful to Worſhip the
<hi>Virgin,</hi> and to faſt every Saturday to her honour. So ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are
theſe <hi>Romances</hi> of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> that the very
<hi>Heathens</hi> would diſdain to apply 'em to their <hi>Diana</hi> or

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> You muſt know, that the Holy places, or
places of Devotion among the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to which they go in
'<hi>Pilgrimage</hi> to Worſhip and invoke ſuch and ſuch <hi>Saints,</hi>
are all founded upon meer <hi>Fables.</hi> For inſtance, the famous devotion
of S. <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Compoſtella,</hi> in <hi>Galicia,</hi> a Province
of <hi>Spain,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Original of the devotion to S.
<hi>James</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </note> is built upon a Fabulous Hiſtory,
which ſaith, that S. <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Greater,</hi> who ſuffer'd
Martyrdom under <hi>Herod Agrippa,</hi> as is related 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the

worſhip'em. It would not be ſafe to call this <hi>Hiſtory</hi> in

<hi>Inquiſition</hi> for doing ſo. Nevertheleſs, 'tis ſo groſs and
palpable a Falſhood, that few underſtanding men in the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church will go about to maintain it. And if it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, it would
not be very difficult to prove, that <hi>S. James</hi> could not have been in

he came too late, and that S. <hi>Paul</hi> had been beheaded ſome time

it more to the purpoſe to ſend this S. <hi>Denis</hi> into <hi>Gaule,</hi>
to plant the Chriſtian Faith there. He comes to <hi>Paris</hi> with
<hi>Ruſticus</hi> and <hi>Eleutherus</hi> his Companions. After this they are
thrown into a dark and naſty Priſon, and loaded with Irons. Some few days
after theſe <hi>Martyrs</hi> were rackt, and after that S. <hi>Denis</hi> is
faſten'd to a <hi>Gridiron,</hi> and roaſted on the Fire; he comes out of
that torment, and is thrown to the Lions, but by making the ſign of the
Croſs he preſently ſtops their Fury, and ſhuts their Mouths. He is
caſt into a burning Furnace, the Fire doth not in <pb n="220" facs="tcp:94715:122"/>the
leaſt hurt him; he comes forth out of the furnace without being ſinged. The
Tyrant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged that no means would be effectual to take away his life, tries
one more, makes him be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on a croſs Gibbet, and his Members
ſtretcht out upon it, in order to quarter him; but neither could they by this
puniſhment put an end to his Life: therupon he is again committed to
Priſon, where he ſung <hi>Maſs</hi> for all the Priſoners: during the
ſervice our B. Saviour comes down from Heaven with all his holy Angels, fills
the Priſon with a glorious Light, and gives S. <hi>Denis</hi> the Communion.
After this the Tyrant cauſeth him and his Companions to be fetcht out of
Priſon, and they are all <hi>Beheaded.</hi> When theſe Heads were
ſeparated from their Bodies, their Tongues mov'd, ſpake and ſung the
Praiſes of God; and to compleat the wonder, the Body of S. <hi>Denis</hi>
riſes up, takes his <hi>Head</hi> in its Arms, and marches two miles from
<hi>Paris,</hi> and throws it into the Boſom of a devout Woman, named

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, they tell us, that the

                  <hi>Jews</hi> his Perſecutors, who reſolved to

               </p>
               <p>The Father and Mother reſolv'd in gratitude to make a Voyage
to <hi>Rome</hi> to be farther confirm'd in their <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> by S.
<hi>Peter</hi> himſelf. They ſet forward in a Ship, but are overtaken by a
Tempeſt, the Lady, big with child, and near her time, is delivered of a Son,
but a little too ſoon by reaſon of the violent Tempeſt, inſomuch that
it coſt her her Life. The diſconſolate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not knowing what to do
with the dead body of his Wife in the Ship, or with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, that might
live, but there was no nurſe to be had for it, he perceives a ſmal Rock in
the midſt of the Sea, he cauſeth both to be carried <pb n="222" facs="tcp:94715:123"/>there, and puts the living Child by the dead Body of the Mother,
covering them with a coat; after this he proceeds in his Voyage to
<hi>Rome,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd what he intended there, and receives
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance from S. <hi>Peter,</hi> that his Wife and Child ſhould both be
reſtor'd to him. Returning from <hi>Rome,</hi> after two years ſtay there,
and the ſhip paſſing near that Rock. He caſt his eyes on that ſide of
the Rock, and perceives a little Child on the ſhore playing with
Cockle-ſhells. He makes towards it, and finds it was his own ſon, who had
ſuckt the breaſts of his dead Mother, and always found milk there. They
remove the coat, and find the body not in the leaſt to be corrupted, yea at
that very inſtant it roſe up, and his Wife alſo was alive; ſo both are
brought back with him to <hi>Marſeilles:</hi> after this you may judge
whether <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> did not make mighty progreſs in the ruin of
Idolatry in <hi>Marſeilles.</hi> The whole <hi>City</hi> was converted to the
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion by her means: and ſhe gave them
<hi>Maximin</hi> her fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Traveller to be their <hi>Bishop,</hi> and
beſtowed on him ſome of our Saviours <hi>Blood,</hi> which ſhe had
brought with her in a Vial. As for her, ſhe hid her ſelf for thirty years
in the hole of a Rock, where ſhe was attended and ſerv'd by Angels, who
carried her every day up into Heaven, where ſhe heard the Heavenly Conſorts
and Hymns of the Bleſſed Spirits, and on this ſhe liv'd. In all
likelyhood this Saint had continued to this day in that rock, if ſhe had not
been taken notice of by a certain holy Prieſt, who ſeeing her thus mount
into the Air, came to the Rock, and diſcourſt with her; The <hi>Saint</hi>
finding ſhe was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, had a mind to live no longer, ſhe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſends for <hi>Maximin</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> 
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:94715:123"/>ſhe receiv'd the Communion from his hands, and was
carried by the Angels into Paradiſe, no more to return to the Earth. I
ſhould think that thoſe learned men have little to do with their time, or
imploy it very ill, who give themſelves the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſeriouſly to confute
ſuch impertinent Foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as theſe are.</p>

many <hi>Miracles</hi> which the <hi>Papacy</hi> makes their <hi>Saints</hi> to
work, that they may oblige men to invoke and Worſhip 'em. God hath
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that there are two Characters by which they may be
diſtinguiſht, viz. the <hi>Impertinence,</hi> and the <hi>Multitude</hi> of
them. <hi>Firſt,</hi> their Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence, for the moſt part, they are
ridiculous, mean, and ludicrous, ſhameful and trifling. For Example,<note place="margin">Ridiculous Miracles attributed to S. <hi>Francis.</hi>
                  </note> Is
it not a <hi>Miracle</hi> unworthy of the Majeſty of God, that of S.
<hi>Prancisd' Aſſiſe,</hi> when he preacht to the <hi>Birds,</hi> and
they held out their Bills, and clapt their Wings in teſtimony of their
Attention and Joy? At another time he took a <hi>Woolf</hi> by the Ears, that
had done great miſchief and ravage in the fields of <hi>Agobio,</hi> and made
a compact with him, that henceforward he ſhould devour or hurt no man, but
that the Inhabitants ſhould provide him what was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to his
livelyhood. Upon a certain day the Devil tempted this <hi>Saint,</hi> he makes
his eſcape, but the Devil after him, and would have thrown him head-long from
a Rock, but the Rock ſplit of: it ſelf in ſeveral places, that he might
be able to take faſt hold with his hands.</p>
               <p>Oftentimes the Devil tempted Brother <hi>Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finus:</hi> but by

<hi>Aperiostuum, &amp; ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coriſabo in illud; Open thy mouth, and it shall
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:94715:124"/>ſerve me for a Cloſeſtool;</hi> this frighted the
Devil, and away he goes in a mighty rage. Brother <hi>Andrew</hi> of
<hi>Annania</hi> had a mind to have ſome little Birds for his dinner, he gets
ſome to be roaſted for him; but when they were upon the table, he bethinks
himſelf, and was aſhamed of his being ſo delicate, he therefore makes the
ſign of the Croſs over the dish, and diſmiſſeth the little Birds,
away they fly, as well as ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were taken and roaſted. Brother
<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi> preacht one day to the <hi>Fishes,</hi> as S. <hi>Francis</hi>
had done to the <hi>Birds;</hi> theſe Fishes that we take to be a dull ſort
of Animales, came all to the top of the Water, and held up their Heads, to
liſten to his Sermon, and when he had done preaching, ſome of 'em gave a
loud cry of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, thus humming the preacher, to the great diſhonour
of the proverb, <hi>as mute as a Fish.</hi> When any ſort of Animals were
ſick, they had only to ſprinkle them with a little of that water, in which
S. <hi>Francis</hi> did wash his wounds, and they were preſently Cured. 'Twas
a rare Fellow this S. <hi>Francis,</hi> 'tis of him that the <hi>Legend</hi>
ſaith, <hi>nihil Chriſtus fecit, quod non ille fecit, imò plura
fecit quam Chriſtus. J. Chriſt did nothing, but what St.</hi> Francis
<hi>did as well as he; yea much more was done by him, than ever Jeſus
Chriſt did.</hi> For certain <hi>J. Chriſt</hi> never did ſo many
wonderful things as they aſcribe to S. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</hi> If a Wall were
crackt, and ready to fall, they needed only to thruſt into the crevice a
lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the Hair of this <hi>Saint,</hi> and it proved more effectual than
the beſt cement in the World. With the Shavings of his <hi>Hair</hi> Devils
were driven away. A <hi>Grashopper</hi> once kept him Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany eight days
together, and when he call'd her, <pb n="225" facs="tcp:94715:124"/>ſhe percht upon his
Head. A <hi>Nightingale</hi> kept him Company one day, and ſung by turns.
'Tis true, that Jeſus Chriſt wrought no ſuch Miracles as theſe, at
leaſt that we know of.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Impertinent Miracles at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to ſeveral
Saints.</note>We meet with one St. <hi>Swithin</hi> in the Legend, who wrought
a more gentile miracle: a Poor Woman in the Country having all her Eggs broke 
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:94715:125"/>by a Maſon, the <hi>Saint</hi> made them whole again;
'twas well worth the while. S. <hi>Aldem</hi> hung his Cloths one day upon a
Sunbeam, as one would do it on a pin. The ſame thing happen'd to one
<hi>Deicola,</hi> being very weary in his Journey, he had a mind to throw off
his Coat which incommoded him; he had ſervants of his own that attended,
which is not very common for the <hi>Saints</hi> to have; they run to offer
their ſervice to take off his Coat; but were prevented by a Sunbeam, which
took his Coat from him, and kept it two or three hours, 'till the
<hi>Saint</hi> had need of it.</p>
               <p>The Miracle of St. <hi>Brigit</hi> ſeems yet to be more
admirable; her Cloaths being very dirty and wet, ſhe had a mind to dry 'em on
the Branch of a Tree, which ſhe ſaw, as ſhe imagin'd, but in reality it
was no Tree, but only the ſhadow of one, but that Shadow did her the ſame
ſervice as the real Tree could have done, ſupported her Cloaths in the Air,
and dryed 'em as well as could be. Saint <hi>Cadrac</hi> might have let his
Staff reſt upon the ground, as other men uſe to do, when he did not uſe
it; but he thought it more expedient to make uſe of the Power of God to make
it hang in the Air. If any have a mind to ſee more of theſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinences
of <hi>Popish Saints,</hi> he may conſult our <hi>Legal Exceptions,</hi> and
will find many more in the Authors, which we there quote. I would fain ask any

ſignifies ſomething that is rare and unuſual. All the Ages of the World
from the Creation to the End of the Apoſtles days, furniſh us but with very
few. I know not whether we can make up <hi>two hundred</hi> in the whole
Hiſtory of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> both of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New</hi>
Teſtament. But if you read the Lives of the <hi>Monks</hi> and
<hi>Saints</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, you find them walk in the midſt
of <hi>Miracles,</hi> they hardly tread a ſtep without working ſome Miracle
or other. God hath been very profuſe of his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence in their favor, they
diſpoſe of his Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Arm more freely than any Prince doth the hands of

               <p>
                  <hi>Dominick</hi> gave the word of Command to the Devils, as a
man would do to the meaneſt of his Servants: in whatſoever form the
Devilappeared, he was ſtill his Maſter: if he took the form of a Dog, or of
a Cat, we have ſeen how he uſed him. If he took the form of a Bird, he
plum'd his Feathers by Siſter <hi>Maximilla:</hi> if he met with the Devil
that had poſſeſt a Body, let him be never ſo obſtinate and
refractory, yet yield he muſt, and with the <hi>Roſary</hi> alone he would
have driven out an hundred Legions of 'em, if there had been ſo many in one
Body. So the <hi>Legend</hi> tells us, that when the <hi>Virgin</hi> had
revealed the <hi>Roſary</hi> to Saint <hi>Dominick,</hi> the Devils made
Heaven and Earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound with their Cries in the Air, ſaying, <hi>Wo, wo

               <p>Reſurrections of the <hi>Dead</hi> are reckon'd among the
chiefeſt Miracles, and they are very rarely ſeen. We read but of
<hi>three</hi> wrought by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. But they are very cheap
and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <pb n="228" facs="tcp:94715:126"/>among the <hi>Miracles</hi> of the Legendary
<hi>Saints.</hi> Brother <hi>William</hi> raiſed but <hi>two</hi> from the
Dead for his part; but Brother <hi>Ambroſe</hi> of <hi>Maſſa</hi>
raiſed <hi>ſix.</hi> Brother <hi>Nicholas</hi> raiſed one from the dead,
and gave new Eyes to a man, who had his Eyes pluckt out; which is much more
than to reſtore to a blind man, who hath Eyes, but cannot ſee. Brother
<hi>Anthony</hi> raiſed ſeveral from the Dead. Brother <hi>Odoric</hi>
raiſed one Brother <hi>Minor.</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Benevent</hi> raiſed two
from the Dead. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher of Brother <hi>John Vafordia</hi> was ſo
ſingular a Remedy againſt death, that the Bodies of all thoſe who dyed of
a violent death, being brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were raiſed without fail. All
theſe were <hi>Brothers</hi> of the Order of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> who
wrought ſuch Miracles.</p>
               <p>Not ſo much as the Women of that Order but had their ſhare
in this gift. The B. <hi>Salome</hi> of the Royal Family of <hi>Poland,</hi>
raiſed ſome from the dead; at one time ſhe reſtored life to a Peacock,
that had been ſtrangled by a Dog. And yet this is nothing in compariſon of
what hath been done by the Saints of the Order of St. <hi>Dominick</hi> St.
<hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Ferrier,</hi> a <hi>Jacopin,</hi> for his own ſhare, raiſed
<hi>eight and thirty</hi> from the dead, and St. <hi>Jacinthe,</hi> a Polonian,
a <hi>Jacopin,</hi> alſo raiſed <hi>fifty two.</hi> And we ſhall ſee
preſently how the Venerable Father <hi>Craſſet</hi> treats thoſe who
are incredulous as to theſe things. As to other <hi>Miracles,</hi> ſuch as
Curing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, opening the Eyes of the Blind, and the Ears of the Deaf,
reſtoring broken Limbs, or paralitick, wither'd Members, or when half hath

<hi>Church</hi> hath almoſt every thing which ſhe could deſire. She hath
the glorious <hi>Foreskin</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The Phyſicians
ſay, that there can be no more than one: but in favour of the Devout, God
hath made ſeveral <hi>Foreskins</hi> of Chriſt: for there 
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:94715:128"/>is <hi>one</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the <hi>Lateran</hi>
Church; formerly there was <hi>one</hi> at <hi>Antwerp, one</hi> in the Abby of
<hi>Charrone,</hi> another at <hi>Langres;</hi> but as to this laſt the Abbot
of <hi>Ville-loin</hi> dare not be very poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. This multiplying of the
<hi>Foreskin</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, is not the thing that moſt troubleth
the learn'd men of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: but 'tis a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion among
them, whether our Lord can have left his <hi>Foreskin</hi> on Earth, for if he
hath, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus Chriſt in Heaven is not compleat, and intire.
About this, theſe Gentlemen have many pretty imaginations, which may be
ſeen in <hi>Suarez.</hi> But the <hi>Devoto's,</hi> who trouble not their
heads with theſe deep, and knotty queſtions, do moſt piouſly adore all
theſe <hi>Foreskins.</hi> They mean well, and this is enough. They cannot
want the <hi>Blood</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; for he ſhed it, on
ſeveral occaſions; at his <hi>Circumciſion;</hi> as his bloody
<hi>Sweat</hi> in the Garden of <hi>Gethſemene;</hi> in <hi>Caiphas's</hi>
Hall; when he was <hi>Scourged;</hi> on the way to <hi>Calvary;</hi> at his
crowning with <hi>Thorns;</hi> and laſtly, on <hi>Mount Calvary;</hi> where
we muſt not doubt, the Holy Women had brought Veſſels on purpoſe, to
preſerve his <hi>Blood.</hi> I ſay, <hi>Holy Women;</hi> for the Men have
always been leſs devout. Perhaps there did not run much <hi>Blood</hi> out of
his Wounds: for three, or four nails, which ſtop up the Wounds made by them,
do not leave much ſpace for the Blood to run out, which alſo preſently
congeles at the Orifices? 'Twas this which made the death of the
<hi>Croſs</hi> tedious and lingring. For if the <hi>Blood</hi> had run out in
great quantity, the patient would have been quickly dead. But in favour of the
Devout, God did ſo multiply the <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt, that at this day
one may find as much, as (if made liquid) would fill <pb n="233" facs="tcp:94715:128"/>the
<hi>veins</hi> of a hundred men and above. They have alſo, even the
<hi>Tears</hi> of Chriſt, Witneſs the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tear</hi> at
<hi>Vendome,</hi> a very choice <hi>Relique:</hi> For 'twas neceſſary, that
a <hi>Devoto</hi> ſhould be preſent at the nick of time; and very dextrous,
to ſave a ſmall drop of water, which falls from the eye upon the cheek, and
is commonly loſt. After this, we muſt not wonder, that they have taken care
to collect ſolid things, as the <hi>Nails</hi> of the <hi>Croſs:</hi> there
were but <hi>three,</hi> but by the bleſſing of God, the <hi>Latin</hi>
Church hath <hi>fifteen</hi> of them, beſides the filings, and little pieces
of theſe <hi>Nails.</hi> And perhaps, who ever would make an exact ſearch
in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> would find as many there, or more. The Holy
<hi>Thorns</hi> of the <hi>Crown</hi> that was put on our Saviours
<hi>Head,</hi> were planted in ſo fertile a Soyle, that they are encreaſed
a hundred for one. The Gentlemen of <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> who are no great
Favorites of Holy Mother the <hi>Church,</hi> have not withſtandingly by
ſome means, gotten one of them, which they order to be devoutly adored, and
which did abundance of <hi>Miracles</hi> in confirmation of <hi>Janſeniſm.
Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Tournay,</hi> a great
<hi>Janſeniſt,</hi> but an honeſt man, dareth not aſſert, that this
very <hi>Thorn</hi> is one of our Saviours <hi>Crown.</hi> But he hath found an
expedient for this, and concludeth, that God worketh <hi>Miracles</hi> by
falſe <hi>Reliques,</hi> as well as by true ones. Perhaps he ſpeaks more
truly than he is aware of; for 'tis certain, that the <hi>Bone</hi> of ſome
<hi>Rogue,</hi> yea or of a <hi>Horſe</hi> worketh more <hi>Miracles,</hi>
then the <hi>Reliques</hi> of Saint <hi>Paul.</hi>

               <p>How can the <hi>Church</hi> complain, that ſhe wants
<hi>Reliques</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſince ſhe hath his
<hi>Croſs,</hi> which is the Glory of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> The

                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:94715:129"/>were very negligent, in not ſeeking out this
<hi>Croſs,</hi> and in ſuffering it to ly buryed under a heap of Earth and
rubbiſh. But St. <hi>Helena</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry happy, that the diſcovery of
this pretious Treaſure was reſerved to her. God hath ſo bleſſed her
Endeavours, that this <hi>Croſs</hi> would at this day fill the whole Palace
of this <hi>Princeſs,</hi> were ſhe ſtill alive. You have every where the
wood of the true <hi>Croſs;</hi> all the world hath ſome, and in certain
places there are large pieces to be ſeen. Beſides this pretious
<hi>Croſs,</hi> which had the honour to touch the bleeding Body of our
Saviour, they ſhew you at <hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>Manger,</hi> where he was
layd, when he was born; they have his <hi>Cradle,</hi> his
<hi>Swadling-bands,</hi> his <hi>Shirt,</hi> his <hi>Shoes,</hi> the
<hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> of preſentation, on which he was layd, when he was firſt
brought to the Temple; pieces of his <hi>Hankercheif,</hi> ſome Fragment of
his <hi>Sepulchre;</hi> they have the <hi>Stone</hi> upon which he trod, when
he aſcended into Heaven; the print of his <hi>Foot</hi> is on it, a certain
proof that the ſtory is true; they have ſome of the <hi>Bread</hi> uſed
at his laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and of that which he multiplyed for the <hi>five
thouſand;</hi> they have ſome of the <hi>Wine,</hi> which our Lord made at
<hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee;</hi> they have the Iron Head of the
<hi>Lance</hi> of St. <hi>Longin,</hi> who pierc'd his ſide; his
<hi>Seamleſs Coat</hi> is at <hi>Argenteuil,</hi> at <hi>Triers,</hi> and at
St. <hi>Salvador</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi> They have his <hi>Hair,</hi> the
<hi>Parings</hi> of his <hi>Nails.</hi> But they have but one of the
<hi>Teeth,</hi> which he caſt in his Childhood, it is at <hi>Laon.</hi> 'Twas
an unpardonable negligence of thoſe honeſt <hi>Devoto's,</hi> who went
about to gather up the cuttings of his <hi>Hair:</hi> why not rather take care
to ſeek up 25. or 30. <hi>Teeth.</hi> which he caſt between the ſeventh

the object of the moſt horrible <hi>Superſtition</hi> in the world. I

<hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> They think it enough to look on this <hi>Worship,</hi>
as a ſottish <hi>Superſtition:</hi> But at the bottom, 'tis far worſe;
'tis a ſhameful <hi>Idolatry.</hi> They fall down, they kiſs, they
worſhip dead things, Aſhes, Bones, Linnen, Toyes, Excrements; they carry
theſe in Proceſſion; they expect rain and fair wheather from them; they
work <hi>Miracles</hi> by them. This <hi>Church</hi> will never waſh off

                  <hi>Images</hi> do naturally follow <hi>Reliques;</hi> the

leſs ridiculous than the preceding, yea is much more ſo than the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous
ſtories of the <hi>Pagan Images.</hi> The <hi>Pagans</hi> have reported only
of two or three of their <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,</hi> that have ſpoken with an
intelligible Voyce: But among the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> formerly nothing was more

                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:94715:130"/>inſtances of this kind are very many. One <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſix</hi>

long diſpute between a Stone <hi>Statue</hi> of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> and a
little one of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which ſhe held in her Armes: The
<hi>Virgin</hi> had a mind to ſhew mency to a Penitent, who lay there before

               <p>The <hi>Pagans,</hi> to procure veneration to ſome

But the <hi>Papiſts</hi> tell more ſtories of their miraculous
<hi>Images,</hi> than ever the <hi>Pagans</hi> did of theirs. For whereas
theſe boaſted only of two or three miraculous <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,</hi> the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> have a hundred ſuch. The <pb n="237" facs="tcp:94715:130"/>
                  <hi>Image</hi> of our <hi>Lady</hi> of <hi>Lieſſe</hi> was
brought down from Heaven to ſome <hi>Picard</hi> Gentlemen: that of our
<hi>Lady</hi> of <hi>Montferrat</hi> was found in a <hi>Grotto,</hi> where it
was worſhipt by Angels. At <hi>Guarde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loupe</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> there is
an <hi>Image</hi> of our <hi>Lady,</hi> that came out of the belly of a
<hi>Cow.</hi> They ſhew us an <hi>Image</hi> of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> that
was brought from Heaven by the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> accompanyed by St.
<hi>Mary Magdelen,</hi> and St. <hi>Catherine.</hi> The Madonna at
<hi>Banelle</hi> was found in the middle of an <hi>Oaketree;</hi> who could put
it there, but God? In the year 1243. was found an <hi>Image</hi> of the
<hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,</hi> miraculouſly graven on the ſtone cover of a well. Among
the miraculous <hi>Images,</hi> the <hi>Vero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica</hi> ought to have the
firſt place: this is the name of a <hi>Picture</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, that
remain'd printed on a Linnen Cloth, with which he wip'd his Face beſmeard
with Sweat and Blood, when he went to be crucifyed, and which he gave to a holy
Woman named <hi>Veronica.</hi> At firſt there was but <hi>one;</hi> but
ſince it is multiplyed into <hi>three.</hi> The principal of them is at
<hi>Rome,</hi> where they ſhew it with great ſolemnity; and whenever it is
ſhewed publickly, all the people fall down, and cry out, <hi>Mercy,
Mercy.</hi> But among theſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous <hi>Images</hi> we ought (at leaſt
for their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity) to reckon thoſe that S. <hi>Luke</hi> made, which are
in great number, and held in great venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They reckon up <hi>ten</hi> or
<hi>twelve.</hi> There are others made by the order of Chriſt himſelf, one
of which was ſent to <hi>Agbarus</hi> King of <hi>Edeſſa.</hi> Shall we
not reckon among the miraculous <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,</hi> thoſe that do work, and
have wrought ſo many <hi>Miracles?</hi> Some have <hi>Swet;</hi> others have
<hi>Flew,</hi> like Birds; others have dropt <hi>Milk,</hi> or <hi>Blood;</hi>
others have been cloathed with <hi>Flesh;</hi> 
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:94715:131"/>ſome
have made themſelves incredibly <hi>Heavy,</hi> when any attemted to take
them up; others have made themſelves as <hi>Light</hi> as Feathers, tho they
were of Braſs and Marble. They have wrought miraculous <hi>Cures,</hi>
without number; heal'd the Sick; reſtored ſight to the Blind; hearing to
the Deaf; and life to the Dead. And F. <hi>Craſſet</hi> hath very lately
told us, <hi>That God hath in every Age, and ſtill continues to work
innumerable Miracles, by the Images of Saints, and eſpecially by thoſe of
the Virgin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We might make ſeveral more <hi>Chapters</hi> of this Fabulous

<hi>Purgatory;</hi> and the Founding of the ſeveral <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> of
<hi>Monks.</hi> To prove the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> and
<hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> we have the moſt extravagant Dreams, which
they cite us as Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they tell us of <hi>Hoſts,</hi> that

<hi>Purgatory;</hi> concerning Priſoners, whoſe Fetters have been looſed;
and other <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by this <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> To prove the
<hi>Orders</hi> of <hi>Monks,</hi> I might relate the <hi>Annals</hi> of each
<hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Annals</hi> that are more fabulous, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times more

<hi>Orlando Furioſo,</hi> related by <hi>Turpin,</hi> and ſung by
<hi>Arioſto.</hi> There is not a Dram of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, Judgment, or Veracity in
the <hi>Authors</hi> of theſe <hi>Chronicles,</hi> that are deſervedly
called ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous. If we will believe'em, the Founders of the
<hi>Franciſcan, Dominican,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Orders,</hi> wrought a hundred
times more <hi>Miracles,</hi> than the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
The <hi>Carmelites</hi> pretend to come from the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> and
draw down from him their Genealogy, that muſt be ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to the meaneſt
capacity. In theſe Relations you have nothing but <hi>Miracles, Viſions,
Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Angels</hi> coming down from Heaven; <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges</hi>
brought down from Heaven by the B. <hi>Virgin,</hi> in favour of the
<hi>Order.</hi> The <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> the moſt modern of theſe
<hi>Orders,</hi> which make ſuch a ſtir in the world, tho founded within
this <hi>laſt</hi> Century, an Age of wit and learning, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
have the Confidence to tell us hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid <hi>Fables</hi> concerning their

<hi>For my part,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I shall not think that I wrong the

               </p>
               <p>Theſe grave Authors, eminent for learning and Piety, as F.
<hi>Craſſet</hi> calls'em, are St. <hi>Antonin,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of

They perſuade'em, that all theſe <hi>Extravagancies,</hi> theſe
<hi>Cheats,</hi> theſe <hi>Fables,</hi> and <hi>Legends,</hi> are at this day

               <p>In the mean while, they ought to know, that F

thoſe Patients whoſe caſe is deſperate, and ſay to 'em; well, even
remain Fools, without judgment, and without conſcience, ſeeing you have a
mind to be ſo; believe that <hi>Vincent Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier</hi> raiſed 38. from the

by your <hi>Caeſarius,</hi> &amp;c. But give us leave to look on you as
perſons given up to a reprobate mind.</p>
               <p>This in my opinion is all that can be ſaid to theſe wretched
creatures. If they were capable of hearing reaſon, we might thus beſpeak
them: Conſider in the name of God, whether it is likely that your
<hi>Monks,</hi> and their Diſciples have wrought more <hi>Miracles</hi> in
<hi>ten</hi> years time, than all the <hi>Prophets,</hi> the
<hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf have wrought in
<hi>two thouſand</hi> years. We might add, Reflect upon the impertinence of
theſe <hi>Miracles</hi> (which we have proved) and judge if it be probable,
that the Wiſdom of God ſhould expoſe his Power to be turn'd into
ridicule, by doing mean, ſottiſh things, and altogether unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming his
Majeſty. The Famous <hi>Maimonides,</hi> a <hi>Jewish</hi> Doctor, in his
Book <hi>of the Foundation of the Law,</hi> makes an important and judicious
remarque. <hi>The Iſraelites</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>did not believe</hi>
Moſes, <hi>becauſe of his Miracles; for one that would not believe,
unleſs there be Miracles, might ſuſpect, leſt the Miracle should be
wrought by Sorcercy, and Enchantment. But all the Miracles, that</hi> Moſes
<hi>did in the Deſert, he wrought them as it were out <pb n="243" facs="tcp:94715:133"/>of neceſſity, and not directly to confirm his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Thus it
was neceſſary to divide the Red Sea, to make a paſſage for the
Iſraelites, and to drown the Egyptians; we wanted food, therefore he brought
down Manna from Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. Indeed this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be remarqu't;
God ſcarce ever hath wrought <hi>Miracles,</hi> meerly to work them, i. e.
ſuch kind of <hi>Miracles</hi> as are properly prodigies, and ſerve only to
diſcover the power of the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. All the <hi>Miracles</hi> of <hi>Ieſus
Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> were miraculous <hi>Cures,</hi>
raiſing of the <hi>Dead,</hi> multiplying of <hi>Bread</hi> to feed the
people. There was always ſome profit, and they were not meer prodigies. And
this is another evidence of the Falſehood of <hi>Popish Miracles,</hi> that
their <hi>Saints</hi> make impertinent prodigies, which are good for nothing,
change pounds of Butter, or heaps of Flegme into Gold, make Light to ſtream
out of their fingers, make uſe of the Sun-beams, or of the ſhadows of
Trees, to hang their Garments on. Never any of the real <hi>Saints</hi> wrought
ſuch like <hi>Prodigies,</hi> that are of no uſe, and good for nothing in
the world. We might further ſay to theſe ſuperſtitious Creatures;
examin the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of thoſe <hi>Authors,</hi> whom you ſtyle Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
for learning and holineſs: Read their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and ſee if they deſerve
not very well thoſe titles, <hi>Men of leaden Hearts, of Iron Months, of
Braſen Foreheads,</hi> as ſome of your own <hi>Catholicks</hi> have called
'em, on the account of their ſtupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, their barbarous ſtyle, and their
impudence in venting notorious Falſehoods for Truths?</p>
               <p>We might alſo ſay to them; Examin the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> of
the <hi>five</hi> firſt <hi>Centuries;</hi> you will find in 'em ſome
relations of <hi>Miracles,</hi> eſpecially in the <hi>fifth</hi> Century. But
is it the thouſandth part, of <pb n="244" facs="tcp:94715:134"/>what is to be read in the
<hi>Chronicles</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> who have liv'd in the laſt ſeven or
eight <hi>hundred</hi> years? The <hi>Fathers,</hi> and the <hi>Authors</hi> in
whom we find the Narratives of theſe true or pretended <hi>Miracles,</hi>
wrought none themſelves. How comes this to paſs? Was the Jacopin
<hi>Vincent Ferrier,</hi> who raiſed 38. from the dead, a greater Saint than
S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> who never raiſ'd one? St. <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> the
famous Champion of the Son of God, and of the Holy Spirit; St.
<hi>Cyprian,</hi> the glorious Martyr; St. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> the famous
Diſciple of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> wrought no <hi>Miracles</hi> at all: but
St. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynthe,</hi> a <hi>Polonian</hi> Dominican, and Father <hi>d'
Avia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> a Capucin, ſhall have the Priviledge to do that, which the
great <hi>Lights</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> for Learning and Sanctity never
did. A man muſt have loſt his reaſon, if he believeth this.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">When the Church was ſorely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted
by perſecution and Hereſie, there was little talk of Miracles.</note>We
might alſo ſay to theſe Gentlemen the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voto's:</hi> Pray tell us,
when the <hi>Church</hi> was cruelly perſecuted by <hi>Heathens,</hi> her
<hi>Doctrine</hi> openly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacqu'd by <hi>Hereticks,</hi> had ſhe not more
need to be ſupported by Signs and Miracles, than in the time of S.
<hi>Francis,</hi> of S. <hi>Dominick,</hi> of S. <hi>John Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Ferrier,</hi> when ſhe reign'd, triumph't, and was without Enemies? And yet,
we hear of few or no <hi>Miracles,</hi> when one would judg, the
<hi>Church</hi> ſtood in moſt need of 'em; afterward we hear of millions,
when the <hi>Church</hi> did not want 'em. But theſe <hi>Miracles</hi>
(they'le ſay) were wrought to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize the new Religions, i. e. the new
Orders of <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> of <hi>Dominicans,</hi> of
<hi>Begging-brothers,</hi> &amp;c. This is ingenious, and well contrived, that
God ſhould work a hundred fold more <hi>Miracles,</hi> to eſtablish the
Order of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> than he had wrought to eſtablish the
<hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve well the deſign of theſe
<hi>Miracles,</hi> of which <pb n="245" facs="tcp:94715:134"/>you have whole heaps in the

Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Saints,</hi> the Worſhip of <hi>Images,</hi> of
<hi>Reliques, Purgatory,</hi> and ſuch like ſtuff. Now is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that God ſhould work no <hi>Miracles</hi> to confirm the Divinity of his
<hi>Son,</hi> and of his Holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> which fundamental
<hi>Articles</hi> were once cruelly oppoſed by the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and
afterwards ſhould work <hi>Miracles</hi> without number, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm ſome
Devotions, which ('tis granted are not neceſſary?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cheats diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered even in our
Age.</note>We might further ſay to theſe <hi>Devoto's,</hi> who would have
us believe all the ſtories of <hi>Miracles,</hi> that are read in the
<hi>Legends,</hi> that if in ſo learned an Age as ours, and in places where
the <hi>Prieſts</hi> have ſo many Eyes to watch 'em, they yet have the
boldneſs to counterfeit <hi>Miracles,</hi> they could ſurely do ſo in an
Age, when they acted behind the Curtain, <hi>i. e.</hi> the ignorance and
ſtupidity of the people, who took pleaſure in ſuch Cheats. And here we
might relate to them a hundred Cheats of the <hi>Monks</hi> in the laſt Age,
and in the preſent one. We might inſtance in the very late, and famous
<hi>Miracle</hi> of St. <hi>Florent,</hi> very night <hi>Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</hi> where
the <hi>Wafer</hi> appeared in the form of a little <hi>Child,</hi> for the
confounding of the <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who had an Academy, <hi>i. e.</hi> the
nurſery of their <hi>Hereſy</hi> very nigh the place. We might entreat 'em
to remember, that the Biſhop of <hi>Angers,</hi> after he had approv'd of
this <hi>Miracle,</hi> was aſhamed of it, when the Cheat came to be known. We
might produce to 'em the <hi>Saint</hi> of <hi>Troye,</hi> a <hi>Nun</hi> that
liv'd on conſecrated <hi>Wafers,</hi> and felt all the torments of the
<hi>Martyrs,</hi> when ever the days of their Paſſions return'd; people
flockt from all parts of <hi>France</hi> to ſee her; but ſhe was found out
to <pb n="246" facs="tcp:94715:135"/>be a Cheat, by the Biſhop of the place, in the year
1673. what is acted at this day, without doubt might be very well acted
formerly.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we might tell theſe Gentlemen, that in caſe God
were obliged to be ſo prodigal of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, he ought to have laid 'em out in
the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> where men go to convert the <hi>Heathens.</hi>
Notwithſtanding we do not find, that he hath done ſo, or at preſent doth
ſo; 'tis true, the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> have publiſht a vaſt number of
pretended Wonders, wrought by <hi>Francis Xavier,</hi> their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle. But
'tis pretty ſtrange, that none knew any thing of theſe Miracles till after
<hi>Xavier</hi> was dead, yea that <hi>Xavier</hi> himſelf knew nothing of
'em. We have his <hi>Letters</hi> (among thoſe written from <hi>Japan</hi>)
wherein the relates every thing he did in that Country, excepting his Miracles;
if God had granted him the Gift of Miracles, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, he ought to
have had the Gift of Tongues. But we find, that he often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, that he
could not edify theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could neither
underſtand them, nor make himſelf underſtood by them: ſince <hi>Francis
Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier,</hi> a vaſt number of <hi>Miſſionaries</hi> have gone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thoſe Countreys, who have not been able to work Miracles, tho they would very
fain have done ſo. And yet I ſuppoſe the deſign which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth 'em
thither, <hi>viz.</hi> to plant the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion among the
<hi>Indians,</hi> is at leaſt as important, as the deſign to eſtabliſh
the Orders of S. <hi>Francis</hi> or of S. <hi>Dominick.</hi> This is what we

ſee, how weak this Entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was, and how Pitiful and falſe this

               <p>V. 2. <hi>And the Beaſt which I ſaw was like unto a Leopard,
and his Feet were as the Feet of a Bear, and his Mouth as the Mouth of a
Lyon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are <hi>three</hi> moſt ravenous and deſtroying

               <p>Behold one of the principal Lineaments of
<hi>Antichriſtianiſm!</hi> let us ſee if there be a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom on Earth to
which this doth agree better than to the <hi>Papacy.</hi> It is a <hi>Lyar</hi>
like its Father; it is a Source of Fables; It is not leſs a
<hi>Murtherer.</hi> The Antichriſtian <hi>Idolatry</hi> began about the end
of the <hi>fourth</hi> Century, and the beginning of the <hi>fifth:</hi> 'Twas
alſo exactly at the ſame time, that the <hi>Church</hi> began to loſe the

of the Goſpel) and turn'd <hi>Perſecutor.</hi> She had always been
perſecuted, and had always condemn'd <hi>Perſecution:</hi> yet ſhe had
contrary to her own principles, begun to perſecute the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts.</hi>
But when <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> (which then was only in the bud) was
come to its full ſhape; 'twas then, that its <hi>Perſecuting</hi> ſpirit
did fully diſcover itſelf. I mean, in the <hi>Wars</hi> between the

Image-worſhippers oppoſed the Orders of their <hi>Emperors,</hi> who had a

reſiſtance forced the <hi>Emperors</hi> to exerciſe ſome Severities on
the Idolatrous party. But when <hi>Idolatry</hi> had got into power, it
retaliated its Enemies double. <pb n="253" facs="tcp:94715:138"/>The
<hi>Image-worshippers</hi> made all <hi>Italy,</hi> and the reſt of the
<hi>Weſtern Provinces,</hi> to caſt off their Allegiance to the

ſee, to whom this Character of a long and conſtant <hi>proſperity</hi>
belongs. It doth not to the Chriſtian <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>three</hi>
firſt Centuries, for ſhe was always in flames and blood. It doth not belong
to the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>fourth</hi> and <hi>fifth,</hi> which kept as

perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by the <hi>Arrians</hi> and other <hi>Hereticks.</hi> But as
ſoon as the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> began to be corrupt, and became
<hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> ſhe began to have reſt. If ſhe was oppoſed by
ſome, ſhe did in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion rid herſelf of 'em; ſhe hath kill'd,
burn't, and diſpatch't thoſe, who had a mind to oppoſe her Doctrines and
her Tyranny. And ſhe had the moſt deſirable ſucceſs, until the
<hi>laſt Age,</hi> when the fatal ruin of the <hi>Papacy</hi> began. Yea,
even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Wound that ſhe got a hundred and fifty <hi>years</hi> ago,
ſhe is ſo recovered, and hath got ſuch ſtrength, that ſhe was
ſcarce ever more glorious. She hath ſubdued new <hi>Kingdoms,</hi>
inſtead of thoſe that were taken from her. She hath perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted at her
old rate, and always overcome; ſhe hath made others bear the Croſs, but

this the Character of <hi>Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> or of
<hi>Antichriſtianiſm?</hi> I 'le make the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> Judge
in the caſe. Let us hear him ſpeak.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Bishop of <hi>Meaux</hi> confeſſeth,
that the Croſs is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from the Church.</note>
                  <hi>The moſt
peculiar Law of the Goſpel</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the command of bearing
the Croſs. The Croſs is the true evidence of Faith; the true foundation of
Hope; the perfect reſining of Charity; in one word, the way to Heaven.
Jeſus Chriſt dyed on the Croſs; he bore his Croſs all his life. On
theſe terms he bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <pb n="263" facs="tcp:94715:143"/>us follow him. He makes this
the price of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life. The firſt, to whom he particularly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
the Reſt of the next World, is a Companion of his Croſs. This day</hi>
(ſaith he to him) <hi>thou shalt be with me in Paradiſe. As ſoon as he
was hung on the Croſs, the Vail that conceal'd the Sanctuary, was rent in
two, from the top to the bottom; and Heaven was opened to holy Souls. 'Twas
preſently after the enduring of the Croſs, that he appeared to his
Apoſtles, glorious and a Conqueror of Death, to let 'em know, that himſelf
muſt enter into glory by the Croſs, and that he had told his Children of no
other way thither. Thus, in the perſon of J. Chriſt was ſet before the
world, the Idea of acomplete Virtue, that hath nothing, and expects nothing
upon earth; which men require only with continual perſecutions; which

                     </gap>th not to do 'em good, and draweth on itſelf
the laſt and worſt punishments, by its own benefits. Jeſus Chriſt
dyeth, not finding gratitude in theſe whom he had obliged, nor fidelity in
his Friends, nor equity in his Judges. His innocence, tho it was
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, did not ſave him; yea his Father, in whom alone he had put
all his truſt, withdraweth all the tokens of his Protection. The juſt one
is given up to his enemies, and dyeth forſaken of God and men, &amp;c. The
wiſeſt of the Philoſophers, ſearching after the Idea of Virtue,
concluded, that of all wicked men he is the worſt, who can ſo conceal his
wickedneſs, as to paſs for an honeſt man, and by this means enjoys all
the credit that virtue can beſtow. And on the other hand, he is without doubt
the moſt vertuous, whoſe virtue (by its perfection) draweth on him the
jealouſy of all men, ſo that he hath none to befriend him, beſides his
own Conſcience, and ſeeth himſelf expoſed to all ſorts of injuries,
and even to the death <pb n="264" facs="tcp:94715:144"/>of the Croſs, whileſt his
virtue cannot do him the ſmall kindneſs of exemting him from ſuch a
punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Is it not probable, that God inſpired the mind of this
Philoſopher with this marvellous Idea of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, intending to give an
inſtance of it in the perſon of his Son; and to let us know, that the
Righteous man hath another Glory, another Reſt, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Happineſs,
than that which can be had on earth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold how his heart ſpeaks, when he is not on his guard,
againſt the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> when he frameth his Idea's from Reaſon,
Goſpel, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. It muſt be granted, that theſe
<hi>Reflexions</hi> would a little better fit the mouth of a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<hi>Proteſtant,</hi> than that of a perſon who liveth at the greateſt
eaſe in a perſecuting <hi>Court.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I ſtand to the Deciſion
of the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux. That the moſt peculiar Law of the Goſpel, is
that of bearing the Croſs.</hi> But let 'em ſhew me, what <hi>Croſs</hi>
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> hath born, from the time that ſhe hath
made material <hi>Croſſes</hi> of Wood, Stone, and Metal the objects of
Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? Where are her <hi>Martyrs,</hi> where are her Perſecutions? Is it
not a prodigy, that for theſe <hi>ſeven</hi> or <hi>eight</hi> hundred
years paſt, ſhe lives at the greateſt eaſe, always victorious? Or if
ſhe hath endured any ſhakings, her own reſtleſneſs, Ambition,
Covetouſneſs, and Cruelty have cauſed 'em. If ſhe will have the honour
of bearing the Croſs, and of reckoning the Perſecutions that ſhe hath
ſuffer'd; ſhe muſt bring into her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the troubles ſhe hath
endured from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors of <hi>Germany;</hi> the oppoſitions they have
made to her grandeur, the bounds they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to ſet to her pride; the
Arms, they were forced to take up, for repreſſing her inſolencies. 
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:94715:144"/>I know of no other ſufferings, that the <hi>Papacy</hi>
hath endured.</p>
               <p>Indeed you ſhall hear Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> and his
fellows tell us very ſeriouſly, that the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,</hi> the
<hi>Henries,</hi> the <hi>Fredericks,</hi> the <hi>Lewis's</hi> of
<hi>Bavaria,</hi> were cruel Perſecutors of the <hi>Church,</hi> and that
under them the <hi>Church</hi> was miſerably afflicted, becauſe ſometimes
they undertook to chaſtiſe the Ambition of the <hi>Popes.</hi> 'Tis true,
if they make <hi>Martyrs</hi> of all thoſe who dyed in the Wars againſt
thoſe <hi>Emperors,</hi> and of all the <hi>Guelfes,</hi> who were ſlain by
the faction of the <hi>Gibellines,</hi> they will not want Confeſſors and
Confeſſion. But I doubt, whether they of Monfr. <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s
principles do like theſe <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and believe, that the deſtiny of
the <hi>Church</hi> (which ought in their judgment to be always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the
Croſs) is fully obtain'd by theſe kind of ſufferers. I know not what
Notions F. <hi>Maimbourg</hi> once a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> had. 'Tis reported,
that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to write the Hiſtory of the <hi>Flourishing of Rome
Chriſtian,</hi> probably he would have obſerved the Method, which he uſed
in his Hiſtory of the <hi>Fall of the Empire.</hi> If ſo, 'tis probable,
that he did not reckon among the <hi>Croſſes</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
all the troubles which the <hi>Popes</hi> endured from the <hi>Emperors,</hi>
who oppoſed their uſurpations.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Papacy</hi> therefore will have <hi>Martyrs,</hi> it
muſt regiſter in its <hi>Martyrology,</hi> all that have dyed in the
<hi>Wars</hi> raiſed againſt <hi>Kings,</hi> by the <hi>Popes;</hi> all

ſince <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> under pretext of Religion, began to lay the
Foundations of <hi>Antichriſt's</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. He was the firſt Author of
that War, that is continued to this day, by his Succeſſors. Firſt they
took from the <hi>Emperor</hi> the Right of Electing the <hi>Popes,</hi> and
gave it to the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and the <hi>People,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Paul,</hi> who had a Treaſure of Divine Philoſophy, ſaith, Be
ſubject one to another in the fear of the Lord: our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign and eternal
Maſter, our Heavenly Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher inſtructs us in the difference between the
Princes of the world and thoſe of the Church; which is this, that the former
rule over their Subjects, and the later ſerve theirs. He that was clothed
with Soveraign Majeſty, took the form of a Servant, miniſtred to his
Diſciples, and waſh'd their Feet: But the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of
<hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> will reign alone; they can ſuffer no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals, and will give
themſelves no reſt, until they have put all things under their 'Feet, and
are exalted above all Authority. Their Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger after Riches, and their Thirſt
after Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours is unſatiable, &amp;c. He who calls himſelf a <hi>Servant of
Servants,</hi> will be <hi>Lord of Lords,</hi> as if he were God; &amp;c. He
ſpeaks as majeſtick, as if he were God; he frames new Projects in his
heart; he deſigns to found an Empire for himſelf, where he is to be ſole
Maſter; he changeth Lawes; he publiſheth his own; he ravageth, he
pillageth, he plundereth, he cheats, he kills. Thus acteth this man of ſin, 
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:94715:149"/>who is called <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> on whoſe Forehead
is writ a name of blaſphemy, I AM GOD, I CANNOT ERR. He ſits in the Temple
of God, and ruleth far and wide. But as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Myſteries of
the H. Scriptures, <hi>(he that readeth let him tenderſtand)</hi> the wiſe
ſhall underſtand, but the wicked ſhall do wickedly, and ſhall not
underſtand. The <hi>Sybills</hi> ſpake plainly of this, a long while ago;
and <hi>Hydaſpes,</hi> a very antient King, (he interpreted by a Child who
prophecyed) left to poſterity the Name <hi>Roman,</hi> a long time before the
<hi>Trojan</hi> people were in the world. And the Oracles of our Prophets have
fore-told this, under other names, and in riddles, that ſo every body might
not underſtand it. The Majeſty of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> who once
governed the <hi>Empire,</hi> is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht out of the Earth, and the
<hi>Empire</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd into <hi>Aſia.</hi> The Eaſt will recover the
Empire, and the Weſt become a Slave. The Kingdom hath been divided, and the
Soveraign Authority parted among many, and at the ſame time weakned and
leſsned, not to ſay that it hath been torn in pieces, &amp;c. The name of
<hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi> is now nothing but an emty Title, and a meer ſhadow. There
are <hi>ten Kings</hi> who have divided the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> among 'em,
not to govern, but to deſtroy it. Theſe are the <hi>ten Horns,</hi> (which
ſeem'd incredible to St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin.</hi>) 1. The <hi>Turks.</hi> 2. The

poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the Roman <hi>Provinces,</hi> and have expell'd the

up, that hath Eyes, and a <pb n="276" facs="tcp:94715:150"/>mouth that ſpeaks proudly;
and <hi>this little horn</hi> hath eſpecially vanquiſht three Kingdoms,
<hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Sicily,</hi> that of <hi>Germany,</hi> that of
<hi>Italy,</hi> and hath forced 'em to ſerve it. Further, it vexeth the
people of Jeſus Chriſt, and his Saints, by an intolerable tyranny; it
confounds divine with human affairs; and commits horrid and execrable
villanies.</q> Is there any thing more plain than this <hi>Prophecy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I never read this <hi>paſſage</hi> without very great
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. There ſeems to be an <hi>enthuſiaſm</hi> in it. And I cannot
conceive, how in ſuch an Age as that, any other Spirit, than that of God,
could beſtow ſo much knowledge. Never any <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> or
<hi>Lutheran,</hi> ſpoke any thing, more clear, more excellent, and exact, to
interpret <hi>Daniel,</hi> or <hi>St. John.</hi> Let thoſe who accuſe at
this day, the applications of the <hi>Prophecies</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi> as
vain fancies, and ſports of wit, learn, that 'tis now <hi>four hundred and
fifty years</hi> ago, there were thoſe who had the ſame ſentiments, and
proved 'em in a moſt convincing manner. But ſome will object, Why did not
the Church of <hi>Germany,</hi> break with the <hi>Pope</hi> at that time, when
it ſo clearly ſaw, and ſo invincibly prov'd that he was
<hi>Antichriſt?</hi> I anſwer,<note place="margin">Why the Germans in the
13th Age, did not break with the Pope.</note> 'twas becauſe the Church of
<hi>Germany</hi> was then divided, <hi>Antichriſt</hi> had there an infinite
number of ſlaves, who kept the reſt in bondage. Thence it was, that even
thoſe who ſo clearly diſcern'd the <hi>Pope</hi> to be
<hi>Antichriſt,</hi> remain'd never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs in the worſt <hi>errors,</hi>
and in <hi>Idolatry.</hi> They deſerved not, that God should give 'em the
Grace, to ſeperate from him whom they knew to be <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.
Laſtly,</hi> the principal reaſon is, becauſe the Time appointed by the
divine Providence, was not come. Only God was pleaſed, that ſuch 
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:94715:150"/>a bright Light ſhould ſhine forth in ſo dark a
night, to ſhame thoſe of after-ages who ſhould Idolize <hi>this
Antichriſtian Power.</hi> 'Tis a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the <hi>Princes</hi> of
our days, that they ſee not that which was ſo plainly ſeen by their
predeceſſors in an age of ignorance, and of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition.</p>
               <p>After this <hi>Paſſage</hi> I shall mention no other,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I can produce none ſo good. That light was not extinguiſht, but
continued and increaſt, till it broke forth with a more than ordinary
luſtre in the beginning of the <hi>laſt</hi> Century. This famous
paſſage of <hi>Eberard</hi> is as the <hi>Text,</hi> to which every thing
ought to be referred that hath ſince or then been ſaid by others; for
inſtance, the remarkable paſſage of <hi>Honorius</hi> of <hi>Autun,</hi>
who in the ſame age paſſing thro all the orders and degrees of people in
the <hi>Church,</hi> Princes, Judges, Eccleſiaſticks, Prieſts, Men,
Women, &amp;c. diſcovers the marks of <hi>Babylon</hi> every where even in
his time. In the ſame Age <hi>William de St. Amour</hi> a Pariſian Doctor,
diſputing againſt the <hi>Mendicant Friars,</hi> the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the
<hi>Pope</hi> and the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> makes no ſcruple to ſay and
prove, that they are the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and ſerve the
Beaſt which hath ſeven heads and ten horns. In the <hi>fourteenth</hi>
Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury <hi>Marſilius</hi> of <hi>Padua,</hi> who vindicated the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<hi>Lowis</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi> againſt the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> and
the famous <hi>Petrarque,</hi> whoſe reputation is to this day ſo
conſiderable in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, have plainly proved by the very
ſame predictions which we make uſe of in our time, and <hi>Eberard</hi> the
Bishop of <hi>Saltsbourg</hi> did in his, <hi>that the Court of Rome is the
Kingdom of Antichriſt.</hi> An Hiſtorian of that age tells us, that a
certain <hi>Carmelite</hi> had the courage to <hi>paint</hi> the Court of
<hi>Rome</hi> and its <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> 
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:94715:151"/>with all the
<hi>colours</hi> of the Beaſt, and of the Whore in the <hi>Apocalypſe;</hi>
it was written to the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf, and affixt on the moſt publick
places of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Avignon.</hi> You may ſee theſe
Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies cited in our <hi>Legall Exceptions</hi> with thoſe of S.
<hi>Brigit,</hi> of <hi>Nicholas of Clemangis, Gregory of Heym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> and
many others. So that we may ſay, this light hath from age to age been
diffuſed in all places, men have allways either foreſeen or ſeen it, that
<hi>Rome</hi> is the ſeat of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and that the
<hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who calls himſelf the Prince of Prieſts,
is the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> and the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyptical Beaſt.</p>
               <p>I here conclude what I intended to ſay to prove the
<hi>Papacy</hi> to be <hi>Antichriſtianiſm;</hi> and I repeat what I have
ſaid in other places, that they who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to darken this Truth, are
criminal againſt Chriſtianity it ſelf; and they who ſee it not, are
prodigiouſly blind and ſtupid. No wonder if <hi>Grotius</hi> and ſuch as
he, be of that number: theſe Gentlemen ſeem to deſign to overturn the
Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> Ought we to
think it ſtrange, that thoſe men who can find the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi>
inſtead of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the 53 Chapter of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
cannot find the <hi>Pope</hi> in the book of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> or in
the Propheſies of <hi>Daniel.</hi> I have ſaid it elſewhere, and I ſay
it again, that they who cannot diſcern the <hi>Pope</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies
of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> will never be able to find our
<hi>Meſſiah</hi> in the predictions of the <hi>Old.</hi> Experience
confirms this; for the ſame men who exclude the <hi>Papacy</hi> from being
intended in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalypſe,</hi> do exclude <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
from almoſt all the Propheſies and Types of the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi> I
would fain know, how any man can make it out to a <hi>Jew,</hi> that Jeſus is
the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> if he yeilds to <pb n="279" facs="tcp:94715:151"/>him, that all
that which is ſpoken of the Paſſion of Chriſt in the 53.
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> may be applied to the Perſecutions and ſufferings which
the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> endur'd? Where are there any Prophecies that may
not as eaſily be turned to another ſenſe as thoſe? If it be granted,
that he ſaith nothing for our opinion in this point, ſhall any wonder that
we are offended at ſo learned a man? Who can with any juſtice complain of
it, ſince we have ſo much reaſon to complain of him; who hath as much as

and the Maſter of thoſe <hi>Literal Interpreters</hi> of our days, who
undervalue all the Myſteries of the Bible, and deſtroy the very Spirit and
Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality of the Holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Becauſe they have taken ſome pains to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſome
parts of <hi>Jewish</hi> or <hi>Pagan</hi> learning, that their labors may not
be loſt, all the Sacred Texts of the <hi>Old</hi> or <hi>New</hi> Teſtament
muſt be underſtood with a relation to ſome <hi>Pagan</hi> rites, or
ſome Cuſtoms of the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> and have nothing in 'em of
ſpirit, Myſtery, or depth. Every one of theſe Gentlemen hath his own
Idol; one of 'em finds that the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> began to diſcover
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the time of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and for that reaſon we
muſt meet with the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> in all the Apoſtolical
<hi>Writings.</hi> Another hath ſtudied the <hi>Egyptian Antiquities,</hi>
and to prove that his time was well imploy'd, we muſt find ſome of the
<hi>Egyptian</hi> Rites in all the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Inſtitutions. Another
believes he hath good Skill in the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
and therefore the moſt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual part of the <hi>New</hi> Teſtament
muſt be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted with reſpect to ſome of the Dreams and 
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:94715:152"/>Fancies of the modern <hi>Jews.</hi> We know very well
that this ſort of Learning, <hi>Jewish</hi> and <hi>Pagan,</hi> is not
unuſeful for the underſtanding of ſome part of Scripture, but 'tis in
ſuch places where ſome Heatheniſh Cuſtoms are treated of, or in
Hiſtorical matters. But by going too far this way, much miſchief is done to
<hi>Religion,</hi> we ſhall ſoon aboliſh all the Types, and deſtroy the
Spirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Law,</hi> and make nothing to be contained in it but a
bare Superficies. We nevertheleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and honour the learning and
merit of the men we ſpeak of: but it were to be wiſh't, that they had
better imployed their parts and learning: and we hope that they themſelves
will at length be ſenſible of it, and perceive that their writings are not
at all to edification.</p>
               <p>However, far be it from us, to impute the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Errors and
Fancies of <hi>ſome few</hi> to any of the <hi>Proteſtant Churches,</hi> to
which they join themſelves; we know of no Chriſtian Church in the

the <hi>Papacy</hi> to be the <hi>Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> that is
Prophetically deſcribed in the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Therefore let it
not be ſaid, that ſuch or ſuch a <hi>Church</hi> is not of this opinion;
for the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a few particular men here and there, are not the
<hi>Sentiments of the Church</hi> in which they live. We muſt ſeek for

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE publick is not to think it ſtrange that I am ſomewhat
concerned for the interpretation that I have given of the <hi>Sixteenth</hi>
chapter of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> touching the ſeven <hi>Vials,</hi> and
ſeven <hi>Plagues.</hi> For it is the ground of the hopes I have conceived of
a ſpeedy delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for the Church. Moſt certainly theſe ſeven
<hi>Vials</hi> are ſeven <hi>Periods</hi> of time; if none of them be yet run
out, we are ſtill many ages from the end of our calamities. I confeſs then
that, that opinion is my Idol; and whether it be Enthuſiaſm or not, 
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94715:154"/>time perhaps will in ſome meaſure diſcover. But be as
it will, I am fully perſuaded that God hath inabled me to find out the true
meaning of theſe wonderful <hi>Myſteries.</hi> And that's the reaſon I
cannot condeſcend to flatter any man as to that point; and ſuch as
entertain another opinion, ought to give me leave to contradict and confute
them, far leſs for my own intereſt, than the common conſolation of the
<hi>Church.</hi> I have ſought out objections againſt my ſelf, have made
all thoſe I could think on, and in my Judgment I have given ſolid
ſatisfaction to all the difficulties which I propoſed to my ſelf
concerning the ſeven <hi>Vials,</hi> and the ſeven <hi>Plagues.</hi> And
ſince I have ſeen the objections that have been ſtarted againſt me, I
have not found any thing in them ſo material as what I have objected
againſt my ſelf. Perhaps it might not be very neceſſary to anſwer the
diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that have been lately publiſhed; For all who underſtand and
reliſh my principles, may eaſily ſatisfy themſelves about the matter.
Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, I am willing to take ſome pains to reclame, if it be
poſſible, thoſe honeſt people who have ſtrayed into by-paths ſo
wide of the true meaning of our <hi>Prophecy.</hi> The chief of them is a
nameleſs <hi>Divine,</hi> who ſome months ſince publiſhed a
<hi>book</hi> entituled, <hi>An Explanation of the Revelation of St. John.</hi>
In ſeveral things he is of the ſame mind with me as to the future; for he
interprets, as I do, the <hi>fourteenth</hi> chapter, where the Viſion of the
<hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt</hi> and <hi>vintage</hi> is, of the two parts of the fall of
<hi>Babylon:</hi> the firſt of which was fulfilled in the <hi>laſt</hi> age
by the preaching of <hi>Zwinglius</hi> and <hi>Luther;</hi> and the other shall
be accomplished about the end of <hi>this,</hi> and the beginning of the next.
He gives the ſame explication exactly to the <hi>eleventh</hi> chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94715:154"/>as I do, ſave that he is far more peremptory in defining
the <hi>time</hi> of the reſurrection of the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</hi> For he
thinks, that the beginning of the <hi>three</hi> years and a <hi>half</hi> from
their death, is to be reckoned from the ſuppreſſion of the <hi>Edict of
Nantes,</hi> which was done in the month of <hi>October</hi> 1685. According to
which he fixes the reſurrection of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> to the year
1689. for my part, I dare not affirm that the death of the <hi>Witneſses</hi>
ought to be reckoned preciſely from the ſuppreſſion of the <hi>Edict of
Nantes,</hi> though I have inclination enough to be of that mind. And therefore
it is that I expect alſo ſome great thing in the year 1689. But that goes
no farther than hope and conjecture; and were it not <hi>that the place or
Street of the great City,</hi> ſeems to me to be <hi>France,</hi> as I have
expounded it, and even in ſome manner proved it, I ſhould be very
apprehenſive, that the death of the <hi>two Witneſſes</hi> were not as
yet come, becauſe, in all appearance, the miſeries that are to befall the
<hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> are not as yet at their height. Now it ſeems
that they should be at that height before one begin to count the <hi>three</hi>
years and a <hi>half.</hi> However, ſeeing the <hi>place</hi> of the great
<hi>City</hi> ſeems to be <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> may
very well <hi>riſe</hi> again there exactly <hi>three</hi> years and a
<hi>half</hi> after they have been put to <hi>death.</hi>
               <note place="margin">page 275. of the explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> In ſhort, that Anonymous
<hi>Divine</hi> agrees likewiſe with me in the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that
the end of the <hi>Papacy</hi> draws nigh. Nay he haſtens it on more than I
do; for I fixt it betwixt the year 1710. and the year 1720. and he fixes it
preciſely to the year 1705. ſo that the only place where he differs much
from me, is that of the <hi>Vials:</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, that not only thoſe
<hi>ſeven Vials,</hi> are not all poured forth, but that they are all ſtill
to be poured forth, and that none of the <hi>ſeven Plagues</hi> 
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:94715:155"/>hath as yet happened. For this he brings ſome Arguments,
and then ſays, <hi>What hath been now ſaid proves the contrary in a manner
that comes near to demonſtration.</hi> I confeſs, I could not forbear being
ſurſpriſed at the reading of theſe words. They were like to have made
me altogether a <hi>Pyrrho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt</hi> as to the interpretation of
<hi>Propheſies,</hi> and to renounce all my pretended evidences. For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
I found how far <hi>Authors</hi> may be tranſported with a fancyfull
fondneſs for their own thoughts, or the thoughts of others they have adopted.
Theſe pretended <hi>demonſtrations,</hi> will he found, for the moſt part
ſo weak, that they hardly deſerve the name of <hi>difficulties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this point the <hi>Author</hi> hath followed the thoughts of
<hi>Mr. de Launay,</hi> who pretends, as he does, that none of the
<hi>Vials</hi> are as yet poured out. But he ought to perceive, that this
thought which may conſiſt with the ſuppoſitions of <hi>Mr. de
Launay,</hi> is wholely inconſiſtent with his. The Hypotheſis of <hi>Mr.
de Launay</hi> tends to the delaying the end of the <hi>Antichriſtian
Empire</hi> till many Ages to come. And ſo he may ſuppoſe that theſe
<hi>Seven Vials,</hi> which are ſo many <hi>Periods,</hi> may have place in
future Ages. But as for him, he puts the end of the <hi>Antichriſtian
Empire</hi> in the year 1705. ſo that it is to laſt no more but
<hi>eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen</hi> years. Nay more, by beginning to reckon the ruin of the
<hi>Papacy</hi> only from the year 1689. the Seven <hi>Vials</hi> muſt be
poured out in <hi>fifteen</hi> years. I wonder how ſuch a thought can come
into the mind of a rational man, who hath habituated himſelf to the ſtudy
of the <hi>Prophets!</hi> I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, the <hi>Author</hi> hath meditated
with ſucceſs; but how hath he forgot himſelf in that place? What! could
not he ſee, that the Figure of the <pb n="5" facs="tcp:94715:155"/>
               <hi>Vials</hi> is
borrowed not from the <hi>Cups</hi> of God's wrath, but from
<hi>Hourglaſſes?</hi> The Shape of <hi>Cups</hi> is altogether contrary to
that of <hi>Vials.</hi> Theſe have a large belly and ſtreight mouth; on the
contrary, a <hi>Cup</hi> is wide above, and narrow below. It may be ſaid,
that theſe <hi>Vials</hi> are poured into <hi>Cups,</hi> to the end men may
drink what was in the <hi>Vial,</hi> as I have obſerved in relating the
common opinion. But having thought on't better, I ſay, that it is not ſo;
the figure of a <hi>Cup</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> comes no where into this
Viſion; the <hi>Vial</hi> falls alwayes either upon the <hi>Earth,</hi> or
upon the <hi>Sea,</hi> or upon the <hi>Rivers,</hi> or upon the <hi>Seat</hi>
of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> or in the <hi>Air,</hi> and never in a <hi>Cup.</hi>
And mark that the <hi>Cup</hi> ſerves no where to repreſent the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God, but when the act of <hi>drinking</hi> comes after; which may ſerve
for an Anſwer to the <hi>Author,</hi> who ſays, <hi>That the word</hi> Vial
<hi>ſignifies alſo a Cup.</hi> For if the <hi>Vial</hi> in this place
ſignified <hi>Cup;</hi> at every <hi>Vial</hi> it would have been ſaid, And
the Angel gave to ſuch and ſuch the <hi>Vial</hi> to drink, and not, He
poured out the <hi>Vial.</hi> For it is not uſual to preſent liquor in a
<hi>Cup</hi> to be poured out upon a <hi>Seat,</hi> upon the <hi>Sun,</hi> and
in the <hi>Air,</hi> &amp;c. ſince it is cle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, that the Holy Ghoſt makes alluſion to
<hi>Hour-glaſſes,</hi> which were properly <hi>Vials</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; it is
alſo moſt clear, that by theſe <hi>Vials</hi> and <hi>Hour
glaſſes</hi> he underſtands <hi>Periods</hi> of time that follow one
another; as <hi>Hour-glaſſes</hi> turned one after another, meaſure
<hi>time,</hi> and mark the <hi>Periods</hi> thereof. If theſe ſeven
<hi>Vials</hi> be Periods of time, how can they be placed within the ſpace of
<hi>fifteen</hi> years? Can they ſhow us any inſtance taken out of any
<hi>Prophecy,</hi> where <hi>ſeven</hi> events marked in great Letters, and
in ſo diſtinct a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the ſeven <hi>Plagues</hi> are, are
propoſed as about <pb n="6" facs="tcp:94715:156"/>to happen in one and the ſame time?
Does not this <hi>Author</hi> himſelf look upon the ſeven <hi>Seals,</hi>
the ſeven <hi>Trumpets</hi> of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and the ſeven
<hi>Vials,</hi> as different <hi>Periods,</hi> into which the Spirit of God
divides <hi>future</hi> time? How can he then reſolve to extend the ſeven
<hi>Seals</hi> and ſeven <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets</hi> to ſo many Ages, and at the
ſame time to confine the ſeven <hi>Vials</hi> within a circle of
<hi>fifteen</hi> years? Nay he will have the <hi>Vials</hi> too to have their
relation to the <hi>Trumpets;</hi> for he ſaith, that <hi>the Sun of the
fourth Plague is probably the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Turks, who is the Sun of the
Empire of the Eaſt; and that as the fourth Trumpet eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed that
Empire, ſo the fourth</hi> Vial <hi>shall shake and overturn it.</hi> I could
remark, that this Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is contrary to all kind of principles. It is
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, theſe ſeven <hi>Plagues</hi> are ſolely deſtined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> that is to ſay,
<hi>Antichriſtianiſm;</hi> and lo, here is one of them that is to fall upon
the Empire of the <hi>Turks,</hi> which is out of the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi>
Empire. The <hi>Author</hi> adds, that the <hi>Subjects</hi> of the
<hi>Turkish</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire ſhall be mortally afflicted at the falling of that
<hi>Vial,</hi> but that inſtead of being <hi>converted, they'le blaſpheme
againſt the Name of God.</hi> And on the contrary, the <hi>Prophecies</hi>
inform us, that when <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall fall, the <hi>Infidels,</hi> and
by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the <hi>Mahometans</hi> ſhall be <hi>converted,</hi> elſe
what would become of the Accompliſhment, <hi>And the fulneſs of
Nations,</hi> which we expect with the fall of <hi>Babel?</hi> I might alſo
add, that that whole Viſion relating to the Empire of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi>
as the <hi>Sun</hi> of the fourth <hi>Plague,</hi> can ſignify none but the
<hi>Soveraign</hi> of the Empire that is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, ſo it can mean none
but the <hi>Pope,</hi> and not the <hi>Emperor</hi> of the <hi>Turks.</hi> I
might obſerve <pb n="7" facs="tcp:94715:156"/>alſo, that this is ſo far from
ſignifying the ruin of the <hi>Turks,</hi> that on the contrary, if it were
ſpoken of them, it would ſignify their exaltation. For the <hi>Sun</hi> is
the <hi>Turkish Emperor,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Author.</hi> Now it is added,
<hi>that he shall ſcorch men with fire.</hi> He will be then conſumer, not
the conſumed. But I wave all thoſe things only that I may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that
if the <hi>fourth Plague</hi> hath its Relation to the <hi>fourth Trumpet,</hi>
it is not at all probable, that the <hi>fourth Trumpet</hi> having laſted far
many Ages, during which the Empire of the <hi>Turks</hi> hath been
eſtabliſhed, the fourth <hi>Plague,</hi> which is to deſtroy it, ſhould
be of ſo ſhort continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The preſent State of the <hi>Turkish</hi>
Empire hath brought that thought into his Head; but that is the thing which
ought to make him loſe it. For now, thinks he, the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire is
begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to fall; the <hi>Plague</hi> therefore, that relates to it, ought to
be put firſt, becauſe the ruin of the <hi>Turks</hi> begins before the ruin
of the <hi>Papacy.</hi> However, it is put but in the fourth place. But what's
the meaning that the ſixth <hi>Vial,</hi> according to that Author,
<hi>deſtroys the Empire of the Turks, and their Religion;</hi> and
nevertheleſs that Empire was beat down by the fourth <hi>Vial?</hi> why
muſt the ſame thing be twice repeated? So here is work enough then for
<hi>fifteen</hi> years, the Empire of the <hi>Turks</hi> to be pulled d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wn, and the <hi>Papacy</hi> to
be ruined. It may be ſo; but as yet we ſee no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of it: Great
<hi>Empires</hi> totter long before they fall. For my part, the converſion of
the <hi>Turks</hi> ſeems more probable to me than the ruin of their
<hi>Empire.</hi> But be they ruined or converted, I am very well perſwaded,
that the <hi>ſeven Plagues</hi> have no reference at all to them, as thoſe
who are to receive them, but only as thoſe who are to make the
<hi>ſixth</hi> Fall upon the <hi>Latin</hi> Empire. <pb n="8" facs="tcp:94715:157"/>All
here is for the <hi>Latine</hi> Empire, all for the Kingdom of the
<hi>Beaſt.</hi> I cannot conceive how one cannot ſee this, if he have but
eyes. But let us a little examin the Authors <hi>Demonſtrative
Reaſons,</hi> which prove, that none of the <hi>ſeven Plagues</hi> have as
yet happened.</p>
            <p>His firſt Reaſon is, <hi>That the fifth Vial is not as yet
poured out, neither by conſequent the two laſt.</hi> If that Reaſon were
good for any thing, yet it would not make for him, who will have none of the
<hi>Vials</hi> to be as yet poured out. For, at leaſt <hi>four</hi> of them
might have been diſpatched. But that reaſon ſignifies nothing, neither
for him, nor any body elſe. For if there be a Plague where of the figures
ſuit rarely well with paſt events, it is that. The <hi>fifth</hi> Plague,
<hi>is the Vial poured out upon the Seat of the Beaſt, and his Kingdom was
full of darkneſs, and they gnawed their Tongues for pain.</hi> The
<hi>Author</hi> pretends, that that darkneſs ought to ſignify a total
overthrow of the City of <hi>Rome, and that the affliction ſignified by
the</hi> dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>which happened to the Papal Empire by the Reformation
of</hi> Luther, <hi>hath not been great enough to exhauſt all the force of
the Terms of this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> I know not why the <hi>Author</hi> will not
acquieſs to the Explanations that have been given there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; for they ſeem
to be of great evidence to me. It is clear, that the Holy Ghoſt makes
allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the <hi>Sun,</hi> ſpoken of in the <hi>fourth</hi> Plague;
<hi>The fourth Plague is the Sun, who is to ſcorch men with his beams;</hi>
that is to ſay, of his Power and Authority. Whereas in that <hi>fourth</hi>
Period, this <hi>Sun</hi> ſcorches men by his Authority; in the
<hi>fifth,</hi> the ſame <hi>Sun</hi> becomes dark, that is to ſay, his
Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority diminiſhes. Now what is it, that renders a Sun darkſom? It is an
Eclipſe. And what is an <pb n="9" facs="tcp:94715:157"/>Eclipſe of the Sun, if it be
not when he is cut into two by an opacous body that comes to divide him? And
could there be a more exact and natural em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem given of that diviſion that
was made of the <hi>Papal</hi> Seat, whereof one half was to be ſeen at
<hi>Rome,</hi> and the other was hid by the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
during the great <hi>Schiſm?</hi> The Seat of the Beaſt is <hi>Rome,</hi>
as the <hi>Author</hi> confeſſes. He alſo very pertinently obſerves,
that the Prophecy ſays not, <hi>That the Seat of the Beaſt,</hi> but that
<hi>the Kingdom of the Beaſt was full of darkneſs.</hi> That is well; but
it is flatly againſt him. For if it be not the <hi>City</hi> of
<hi>Rome,</hi> to which that <hi>plague</hi> of darkneſs is to be adjudged,
ſhe is not then to be ruined by that plague. It is the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that
is to ſay, the Authority, power, credit; and ſo it came to paſs actually
in the great <hi>Schiſms,</hi> and in the <hi>Councils</hi> of
<hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> where the Authority of the
<hi>Popes</hi> ſuffered ſo great a diminution. But, ſaith he, what the
<hi>Conncil</hi> of <hi>Conſtance</hi> did againſt the <hi>Papal See,</hi>
is ſo far from being ſufficient to anſwer the Idea which theſe words
give, and <hi>the Kingdom of the Beaſt was full of darkneſs,</hi> that even
the <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Luther</hi> comes ſhort of the importance of
thoſe terms. So that he will have theſe words to ſignifie a total
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the <hi>Papacy.</hi> But by what rule, and in what language
does darkning neceſſarily ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie total ruin? And how could the fifth
<hi>plague</hi> ſignify the total ruin of the <hi>Papacy</hi> and
<hi>Babylon,</hi> when <hi>Babylon</hi> appears again in the ſeventh
<hi>plague? The great City was divided into three parts. Great Babylon came in
remembrance before God,</hi> that ſhe might be deſtroyed; ſhe was then
ſtill in being, and not ruined by the fifth <hi>Vial.</hi> The fifth
<hi>plague</hi> falls upon the Seat of the Beaſt, that is, <hi>Rome.</hi>
That does not ſignifie neceſſarily that <hi>Rome</hi> 
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:94715:158"/>is Sacked, and reduced into aſhes like <hi>Sodom.</hi>
It is enough that <hi>Rome</hi> hath received a great blow. And that befell her
when ſhe loſt her <hi>Popes,</hi> who tranſported their See to
<hi>Avignon.</hi> She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a kind of deſart. <hi>The Kingdom of the
beaſt was full of darkneſs.</hi> Where the Holy Ghoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes to
darkneſs cauſed by an Eclipſe, or elſe to the darkneſs wherewith
<hi>Moſes</hi> covered <hi>Egypt:</hi> which ſoever of the two it be, that
does not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port deſtruction. For the throne of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was not
exterminated, though <hi>Moſes</hi> covered it with thick darkneſs; and a
luminary periſhes not when it ſuffers an Eclipſe. So that
<hi>darkneſs</hi> does no wayes import a total deſtruction. And by
conſequent that firſt reaſon proves not that the ſeven <hi>plagues</hi>
are not as yet fulfilled.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Argument alledged by the <hi>Author,</hi> is indeed
the only thing that may be termed diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; for, with his leave, I'le ſay,
that the reſt deſerve not that name. The difficulty conſiſts in this,
that the Holy Ghoſt ſays, that the ſeven <hi>Vials</hi> are <hi>the
laſt plagues, and that by them the Wrath of God is accomplished.</hi> If they
be the laſt <hi>plagues,</hi> they are not then the Judgments of God, which
are already fallen upon the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Empire; for ſeeing that
<hi>Empire</hi> is ſtill in being, and that ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> are <hi>plagues</hi> ſtill to be expected
againſt it, thoſe which are to come are the laſt, and thoſe that are
paſt can only be the firſt. This is an objection that will be every whit as
good the night before the laſt day of the duration of the
<hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Empire, as it is at this day. For the blow which
ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the ruin of that <hi>Empire</hi> will be the laſt, and ſo
alſo it may be ſaid then, none of theſe <hi>plagues</hi> have as yet
happened; for <hi>Babylon is ſtill in being.</hi> And where is it to be
found, that every one of theſe <hi>plagues</hi> ought to pull
<hi>Babylon</hi> down? <hi>Babylon</hi> is to <pb n="11" facs="tcp:94715:158"/>ſtand till
the laſt moment of the laſt <hi>plague;</hi> for it is that laſt moment
which ought to throw it down. She'le ſtand as a great tree beaten by a
ſtorm, which receives <hi>ſeven</hi> thunder ſtroaks, that bruiſe it
and deſtroy its verdure. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs it is only the laſt that layes it
flat upon the ground. But, it may be ſaid, how can <hi>plagues</hi> that have
laſted ſeven or eight <hi>hundred</hi> years, and began ſo long ago, be
called <hi>the Laſt?</hi> They who make this <hi>objection,</hi> ought to
call to mind, that in the ſtile of Holy Scripture, all that brings a thing to
its end, is called the laſt, of whatſoever length it be. The ſame
objection exactly may be made to us, when we alledge the text of the <hi>fourth
chapter</hi> of the firſt <hi>epiſtle</hi> to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy; The Spirit
ſpeaketh expreſly, that in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times ſome shall depart from the
faith.</hi> That ought not to happen then, may one ſay, before the end of the
world, and the end of time. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the words of St. <hi>John,</hi> that
it was a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition firmly believed in the time of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi>
that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> was not to come till the laſt times. And by this
the <hi>Papiſts</hi> back their chimerical whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, that
<hi>Antichriſt</hi> is not to come till 3 or 4 years before the end of the
world. But St. <hi>John</hi> anſwers: <hi>Little children; it is the laſt
time;</hi>

               <hi>and as ye have
heard that Antichriſt shall come, &amp;c.</hi> The laſt time was then
already, and nevertheleſs it is above <hi>ſixteen</hi> ages ſince St.
<hi>John</hi> began to reckon that laſt time which ſtill continues. That is
half as, long again as the duration of the ſeven <hi>Periods,</hi> which we
have aſſigned to the ſeven <hi>Vials</hi> and ſeven <hi>Plagues.</hi>
So begin theſe ſeven <hi>Plagues</hi> where you pleaſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they
lead the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Empire to its end, they are ſtill the
laſt <hi>plagues.</hi> It is certain, that the laſt time includes the whole
duration of the <pb n="12" facs="tcp:94715:159"/>
               <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Empire. Now we
agree that that duration is of 1260 <hi>years;</hi> if a duration of 1260 years
may be called the laſt <hi>times,</hi> upon better reaſon,
<hi>plagues,</hi> which laſt ſeven or eight hundred <hi>years,</hi> may
very well be called the laſt <hi>plagues.</hi> And though theſe
<hi>plagues</hi> did wholly take up all the laſt times, they might very well
be called the <hi>laſt plagues.</hi> For it is natural to call thoſe the
<hi>laſt plagues</hi> which happen in the whole duration of the laſt
times.</p>
            <p>But, it may ſtill be ſaid, he that ſays <hi>laſt
plagues,</hi> ſuppoſes that there have been <hi>former;</hi> now ſeeing
we begin the <hi>plagues</hi> that have fallen upon the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> in the
<hi>tenth</hi> age, it will be asked what <hi>plagues</hi> that
<hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Empire ſuffered before that time? I might Anſwer,
that the terms of <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Laſt,</hi> which are relatives,
and refer to one another, are not always ſo in Scripture, nor yet in the
ſtile of other languages: <hi>St. Luke</hi> ſays, <hi>that Mary brought
forth Jeſus her firſt begotten ſon;</hi> that has no relation to a
ſecond and a laſt, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies not that the <hi>Virgin</hi> had other
children. It is enough to be <hi>firſt,</hi> that there were none before; and
it is not neceſſary that there be others after. In the ſame manner, to be
<hi>laſt,</hi> it is enough that there have been none after, but it is not
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that there have been others before. I might Anſwer alſo,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat the Holy Ghoſt may
have reſpect to thoſe ſmaller <hi>plagues;</hi> that is, to thoſe
firſt mortifications which the <hi>Antichriſtian Roman</hi> Empire
ſuſtained from the <hi>fifth</hi> age, which is that of its birth, to the
<hi>tenth</hi> age, wherein we have given beginning to the ſeven laſt
<hi>plagues.</hi> For it is certain, that that <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Empire
was not eſtabliſhed without croſſes, oppoſitions and heavy Judgments
of God. <hi>Rome</hi> the Seat of that <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian</hi> 
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:94715:159"/>Empire was afflicted by the <hi>Vandals,</hi>
poſſeſt by the <hi>Goths,</hi> laid deſolate by <hi>Beliſarius</hi>
and <hi>Nariſes,</hi> who retook it from the <hi>Goths,</hi> cruely
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed by the <hi>Lombards;</hi> beſides that, the <hi>Bishop</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> met with great difficulties to ſtruggle with from other
<hi>Bishops,</hi> in the ſettlement of his <hi>Monarchical</hi> power. The
great <hi>Schiſm</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> which ſeparated above the
half of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> was
a very great <hi>Plague.</hi> For the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> pretending
Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction over all the <hi>Churches</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> it was a
great leſſening of his power, when they with-drew themſelves from the
dominion which he pretended to have over them. Thus thoſe <hi>ſeven</hi>
laſt <hi>Judgments,</hi> which God hath made to fall upon the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> within theſe 800 years, may very well be called the laſt
<hi>plagues,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to thoſe that went before them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
we have no need of this ſolution, becauſe in reality theſe <hi>ſeven
Plagues</hi> are not called <hi>the laſt,</hi> with relation to what we have
been now ſpeaking of, but with reference to the <hi>ſix</hi> firſt
<hi>Plagues,</hi> that God made to fall upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire under
the <hi>ſix</hi> firſt <hi>Trumpets.</hi> For it is to be obſerved, that
the <hi>revelation</hi> makes mention of <hi>thirteen</hi> notable
<hi>plagues,</hi> which fall upon the Empire of the <hi>fourth</hi> beaſt.

            <p>My Readers, I hope, will pardon this whimſey of mine, if it be
one; they have pardoned the like in many others; but in ſhort, I cannot but
be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, but that if one would take the pains to penetrate into my
<hi>principle,</hi> and examin it atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively without prejudice, he could not
but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſs to it, it is ſo juſt, clear, and congruous to the
events.</p>
            <p>To make this appear, I will hear give an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment</hi> of
it, that ſo what I have now ſaid of the <hi>ſix</hi> firſt and
<hi>ſeven</hi> laſt <hi>Plagues</hi> may be put out <pb n="15" facs="tcp:94715:160"/>of
doubt. It is to be remembred then, 1. that according to me, the whole
<hi>Revelation</hi> is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary upon what <hi>Daniel</hi> had ſaid in
ſhort of the <hi>fourth</hi> Monarchy, that is, the <hi>Roman Empire.</hi> 2.
Now that <hi>Roman Empire</hi> hath two great <hi>Periods,</hi> almoſt of the
ſame duration. The firſt is the worldly and Heatheniſh <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire, which continued ſomewhat more then 1200. <hi>years,</hi> from the
foundation of <hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>Valentinian</hi> the third, the laſt
Emperor of the <hi>Romans;</hi> the ſecond will endure 1260. years from the
midle of the <hi>fifth</hi> Age, to the beginning of the <hi>eighteenth.</hi>
3. That whole <hi>Empire</hi> with its two <hi>Periods</hi> is Myſtically
repreſented to us in the <hi>firſt</hi> Beaſt of the
<hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> chap. 13. it hath ſeven <hi>Heads,</hi> which

<hi>Roman</hi> Empire. 1. <hi>Kings.</hi> 2. <hi>Conſuls.</hi>

<hi>Roman</hi> Empire under another form, and that <hi>Head</hi> alone makes a
ſecond <hi>Period</hi> to that <hi>Empire,</hi> and alone continues 1260.
years.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And becauſe of its long duration, and that this
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire hath a Name and Form diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the civil and
<hi>Pagan Roman</hi> Empire, therefore the Holy Spirit do's in this 13.
<hi>Chap</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent it apart as a <hi>diſtinct Beaſt,</hi> having
<hi>two Horns</hi> as a <hi>Lamb,</hi> and ſpeaking as a <hi>Dragon.</hi> As
to the <hi>firſt period</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, there was no need
that the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſhould mark its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and progreſs, ſeeing
it was not only formed, but riſen to its height and grandure in his time. So
that all which was neceſſary for him to do, was to ſpeak of its decay,
and of the ſeveral Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <pb n="16" facs="tcp:94715:161"/>of God, which ſhould
bring it to its end, and this <hi>St. John</hi> hath likewiſe done. But as to
the <hi>ſecond Period</hi> of this <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> reviving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a
new Form, and under the name of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church,</hi> it being ſtill
future, and yet to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, he was to give us the Hiſtory of its growth, as
well as of its decay, which as we ſhall ſee he hath alſo done.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>Prophet</hi> then conſidering the whole
continuance of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> as well with reſpect to that which
remained of it as <hi>Pagan,</hi> as in reference to that which was to riſe
and ſubſiſt under the Name of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> to the time of
the arrival of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, he doth divide it
firſt into <hi>Seven Seals.</hi> And under the <hi>ſix</hi> firſt
<hi>Seals,</hi> he predicts all that ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal it under the Heathen
<hi>Emperors,</hi> till the time of <hi>Conſtantin</hi>'s overthrowing
<hi>Paganiſm,</hi> and his advancing the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> to the
Throne.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Now this Revolution having made a great change on the
ſtage of the World, the Holy Spirit therefore makes a ſtop here, and
ſuffers the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, now become <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> to enjoy
a little Reſt, while the Succeſſors to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſhould
finiſh the ſubverſion of <hi>Paganiſm.</hi> And then the <hi>ſeventh
Seal</hi> is opened, which being ſubdivided into <hi>ſeven Trumpets;</hi>
theſe <hi>Trumpets</hi> run along with, and divide the whole remaining
duration of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, as well <hi>Civil</hi> as
<hi>Eccleſiaſtical.</hi> Whereof the <hi>ſix</hi> firſt
<hi>Trumpets</hi> reach unto the <hi>tenth Age,</hi> and bring forth <hi>ſix
Plagues,</hi> that afflict, overthrow, and totally deſtroy the
<hi>Worldly</hi> or <hi>Civil Roman Empire.</hi> Theſe <hi>Plagues</hi> are,
(1) The Inundation of the <hi>Empire</hi> by the Barbarous Nations under
<hi>Theodoſius</hi> the younger. (2.) The taking and deſolating of
<hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> 
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:94715:161"/>and almoſt all the
Weſtern <hi>Provinces,</hi> under <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius</hi> and <hi>Alaricus.</hi>
(3.) The Invaſion of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces by the <hi>Goths, Huns,</hi> and
<hi>Vandals,</hi> and their erecting ſeveral Kingdoms in <hi>Spain,
Africk,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> and in <hi>Panonia.</hi> (4.) The
fourth <hi>Plague</hi> was the total deſtruction of the Weſtern
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire under <hi>Valentinian,</hi> by <hi>Genſericus,</hi>
King of the <hi>Vandals</hi> in <hi>Africk.</hi> (5.) The fifth <hi>Plague</hi>
is the Riſe of the <hi>Sarraſin</hi> Empire, which deſtroyed the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire in the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> (6.) Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the
<hi>ſixth</hi> of the firſt <hi>Plagues</hi> is the Empire of the
<hi>Turks,</hi> which wholly ſubverted and overthrew the <hi>Oriental
Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Now while the providence of God was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the
<hi>Grecian</hi> Empire under the <hi>fifth</hi> and <hi>ſixth</hi> Trumpets,
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire revived in the <hi>Weſt</hi> under the Name of the
<hi>Roman Church.</hi> The <hi>Beaſt</hi> with <hi>two Horns</hi>
exerciſeth all the power of the <hi>firſt Beaſt;</hi> he makes an
<hi>Image</hi> reſembling the firſt <hi>Empire;</hi> he makes it to be
worſhipped; he worketh Signs and Wonders; cauſeth Fire to come down from
Heaven, and deceiveth the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Earth. He giveth life to this
<hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> of the Beaſt, cauſeth it to ſpeak, and maketh this
<hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which he re-eſtabliſhed under
the name of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> to act with power and efficacy. So that
he cauſeth all thoſe to be killed, that will not yield a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to this
<hi>Image</hi> of the Empire. And he will have all the Inhabitants of the Earth
to bear his <hi>Name,</hi> and his <hi>Mark,</hi> and his <hi>Number,</hi> and
that they call themſelves Members of the <hi>Roman La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Church. And
this contains the Hiſtory both of the Birth, and of the Progreſs of this
new <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> under the <hi>fifth Trumpet,</hi> and under the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the <hi>ſixth.</hi>

            <p n="8">8. The <hi>ſixth Trumpet</hi> having brought the Worldly
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire to its final Ruin, there remains nothing more for it to
do with reſpect to that; and therefore it is that it comes to be
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided into 7. <hi>Vials,</hi> which are deſigned for the ruining of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire as <hi>Eccleſiaſtical.</hi> And theſe
<hi>Vials</hi> do preciſely begin at the ſounding and at the beginning of
the 6th Trumpet. Which <hi>Trumpet</hi> runs paralel with and reacheth unto the

for the deſignation of <pb n="19" facs="tcp:94715:162"/>Times, is that he may thereby
avoid confuſion. It being evident, that if he had all along uſed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one
of theſe Figures, there would have been much more obſcurity, and leſs
diſtinction, in the Intimation which he gives of Times. Carrying then the
remembrance of this with us; the <hi>firſt Seal</hi> beginneth at the Time of
<hi>S. Iohn;</hi> and the <hi>ſeventh Seal</hi> openeth and commenceth after
the death of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> and comprehendeth
<hi>thirteen Plagues,</hi> which are contained under the ſounding of
<hi>ſix Trumpets,</hi> and under the Effuſion of <hi>ſeven Vials.</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>x <hi>Plagues</hi> under
ſix <hi>Trumpets,</hi> which deſtroy the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> as worldly
and purely Temporal. The ſixth <hi>Trumpet</hi> is ſubdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into ſeven
<hi>Vials,</hi> as the ſeventh <hi>Seal</hi> was into ſeven
<hi>Trumpets.</hi> And theſe ſeven <hi>Vials</hi> are the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven laſt
<hi>Plagues,</hi> which bring the ſecond <hi>Period</hi> of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire, that is to ſay, the <hi>Empire</hi> of the
<hi>Church,</hi> to its end; as the <hi>ſix Trumpets</hi> had brought the
worldly <hi>Roman</hi> Empire to its end.</p>
            <p>I would now after this think, that no man ſhould find any
difficulty in the objections of theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and that every one ſhould
eaſily compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend why the <hi>Vials</hi> and the <hi>plagues,</hi> which
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue near <hi>eight hundred</hi> years, come to be called the
<hi>laſt.</hi> They are thus ſtiled, (1) becauſe they ſerve to
diſtreſs and ruin the ſecond and laſt period of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire, which carries the name of the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> whereas the
<hi>ſix</hi> firſt <hi>plagues</hi> were employed for the ruining of the
firſt <hi>Period</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> worldly Empire, and which ſtill
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the name of the <hi>Roman Empire.</hi> (2) Becauſe theſe
<hi>ſeven Plagues</hi> did really in the order of Time follow the
<hi>ſix</hi> firſt, and all ſucceſſively fell, the ſix
<hi>firſt</hi> as well as the ſeven <hi>laſt,</hi> upon one and the
ſame <hi>Empire,</hi> upon one and the ſame <hi>Beaſt,</hi> in 
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94715:163"/>their two <hi>Periods.</hi> So that by reaſon of the
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the one to the other, they ought to be ſtiled the
<hi>firſt</hi> and the <hi>laſt.</hi> Finally, they are called the laſt
<hi>plagues,</hi> becauſe none ſhall come after them. And to thoſe whom
theſe anſwers are not ſatisfactory, I have nothing farther to ſay upon
this ſubject.</p>
            <p>Nor is it difficult after what I have ſaid, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to two
<hi>objections,</hi> which contain nothing in them ſave what depends upon
this principal diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. The <hi>firſt</hi> Objection is, that the Holy
Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſaith, that by <hi>the ſeven plagues the wrath of God is
fulfilled;</hi> whereas ſay theſe Gentlemen, the Wrath of God is not yet
conſummated upon <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> foraſmuch as it ſtill
ſubſiſteth. When I ſay, that I am to give ſeven blows to this houſe
in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to overthrow it, is it thereby meant that the firſt of theſe
ſtrokes ſhall overturn the houſe? Aſſuredly not. But all thereby
intended, is, that the ſeventh blow ſhall finiſh the ſubverſion of
that houſe. They ought to remember, that I have ſaid, the ſeventh
<hi>Vial</hi> is not yet run out. It runneth from the time of <hi>Luthers</hi>
preaching until <hi>this day,</hi> and will continue to run out till the entire
deſtruction of the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Empire. And ſo long as the
<hi>Vial,</hi> that is, ſo long as the <hi>Period of Time</hi> is a running,
ſo long doth the <hi>plague</hi> continue; nor will the deſtruction of that
<hi>Empire</hi> be conſummated, until the laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the
<hi>hourglaſs</hi> or <hi>Vial,</hi> and until the laſt moment of the
laſt <hi>plague.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this had been thought upon, theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would have found
no room for that objection, which they advance from the words which the
ſeventh <hi>Angel</hi> ſaith upon the pouring out of the ſeventh
<hi>Vial,</hi> namely, <hi>that 'tis finished;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as 
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94715:163"/>ſay they, <hi>Babylon</hi> being ſtill ſtanding, it
is not true that <hi>'tis finished,</hi> nor by conſequence, that the
ſeventh <hi>Vial</hi> is fallen. I ſay, if they had remembred what I had
anſwered for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting this objection, they would not have a ſecond
time made it. We are then to know, that the word, <hi>it is done,</hi> has
relation to the whole continuance of the <hi>Vial</hi> and of the
<hi>plague.</hi> The <hi>Vial</hi> hath run, and the <hi>plague</hi> hath
endured ſince the preaching of <hi>Luther;</hi> and the <hi>Vials</hi> will
continue to run, and the <hi>Plague</hi> to endure until the entire
deſtruction of the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Empire. Had I ſaid, that the
<hi>ſeven Vials</hi> are entirely poured forth, finiſhed, and run out, and
that the ſeventh <hi>plague</hi> is wholly accompliſhed, they would in that
caſe have had reaſon to make this Objection. But I expreſly ſaid, that
the ſeventh <hi>plague</hi> is divided into <hi>two</hi> other, whereof the
one is called the <hi>Harveſt,</hi> and the other the <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> in
the 14th <hi>Chap.</hi> The <hi>Harveſt</hi> is the firſt part of the
laſt <hi>plague,</hi> and is the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the fore-going Age:
and the <hi>Vintage</hi> is the ſecond part of the ſaid laſt
<hi>plague,</hi> and will be the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> of the next
<hi>Age.</hi> Now this ſecond part of the laſt <hi>plague,</hi> which is
ſtill to come, will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly be the moſt conſiderable, and will
come up unto and anſwer the whole ſignification of the word, <hi>it is
done.</hi> For altho the word hath a relation to the firſt <hi>Reformation of
the Church,</hi> by which almoſt a half of the <hi>Papal</hi> Empire was
overthrown; yet it moſt eſpecially reſpects the ſecond
<hi>Reformation,</hi> which is to finiſh the ruin of the
<hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Empire. In a word, that which is ſignified by <hi>it
is done,</hi> is that the laſt <hi>Vial,</hi> which is finally to deſtroy
the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Empire, is pouring forth, and is running; and 
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94715:164"/>that when it ſhall be wholly run out, <hi>Babylon</hi>
ſhall be wholly deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>But I will propoſe one difficulty upon this, which theſe
Gentlemen have not made. For it may be askt, whence is it that I do ſuppoſe
that the <hi>Reformation</hi> made the <hi>laſt</hi> Age, and that which is
to be made the <hi>next</hi> Age, come to make but one general <hi>plague</hi>
that hath two parts; ſeeing theſe two <hi>Reformations</hi> are ſo
conſiderable, and ſo far diſtant the one from the other, as to make two
<hi>Vials,</hi> and two diſtinct <hi>plagues.</hi> This difficulty is much
greater, than any of thoſe they have made to me; for it is both ſpecious,
and wholly breaks the order which I have aſſigned of the ſeven
<hi>Vials</hi> and of the ſeven <hi>plagues.</hi> But to this I have divers
things to Reply; which I Judg to be very ſolid. Whereof the firſt is, that
the Holy Spirit hath comprehended both theſe <hi>Reformations</hi> under one
and the ſame <hi>plague,</hi> becauſe the Space and Period is the ſame.
We have obſerved, that the ſeveral <hi>plagues,</hi> are things different
from one another. The corruption of the <hi>tenth</hi> Age, which rendred the
<hi>Antichriſtian See</hi> odious; the <hi>Croiſados;</hi> the Exceſs of
<hi>Papal</hi> Tyranny, which vexed the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Europe;</hi>
the great <hi>Schiſm</hi> in the <hi>Weſt;</hi> the Invaſion of the
<hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Provinces by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the <hi>Reformation,</hi>
are one and the ſame kind of puniſhment, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Holy Spirit did not
think it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to make two <hi>plagues</hi> of them. But one may object,
that according to my Expoſition of the <hi>Viſions,</hi> God hath made two
<hi>plagues</hi> of the two <hi>Reformations?</hi> There are two reaſons of
that difference. The <hi>firſt</hi> is, becauſe the <hi>Croiſados</hi>
are naturally branched into two parts by the loſs of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
which was the ſcope and deſign of <pb n="23" facs="tcp:94715:164"/>the Conqueſts.
'Twas about the year 1093. that men begun to be impetuouſly carried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that Holy or <hi>Croiſado</hi> War, by means of one called <hi>Peter</hi> the
<hi>Hermite;</hi> and in the year 1187. eighty years after the firſt deſign
of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> was <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> retaken by
<hi>Saladin.</hi> And as this made a Period of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable length, ſo
this was ſuch an eminent event in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Croiſado's,</hi>
that it is no wonder if the Holy Spirit made the retaking of
<hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> by <hi>Saladin,</hi> one <hi>Epoch,</hi> and that he
there ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated. Theſe Wars continued a hundred years, after the loſs of
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but ſo feebly, that the Holy Spirit repreſents this
ſecond <hi>Period</hi> of the <hi>Croiſado's</hi> only as a <hi>River of
Blood,</hi> whereas he had repreſented the firſt as a <hi>Sea of
Blood.</hi> Now we have no ſuch ſignal Event in the midſt of the duration
of the <hi>ſeventh Plague,</hi> as to make it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible into two, which is
the reaſon that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit hath made it but one <hi>Plague.</hi>
Moreover, there is no ground for dividing the two <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations</hi> into
two <hi>Plagues,</hi> becauſe they are but one <hi>Plague</hi> continued, and
carried on without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption. Whereas the <hi>Croiſado's</hi> had two
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable interruptions, not only by <hi>Truces,</hi> but by a peace made
with the <hi>Sarazins,</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the taking of
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Saladin.</hi> I ſay, there hath been no
interruption in the work of <hi>Reformation,</hi> in that the
<hi>Reformation</hi> conſiſts in the clearing up of the Truth. For tho
ſince the time of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> the <hi>Papacy</hi>
inſtead of continuing to decay in its power, hath in ſome degree recovered
what it had loſt; yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Truth hath alway's acquired freſh
ſtrength: and hath from day to day for above theſe 150. <hi>years</hi> been
ſo illuſtrated and cleared up, that <pb n="24" facs="tcp:94715:165"/>it ſeems at this
time to be arrived at the utmoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that it is capable of; and which
will not fail er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> long to
bring a total ruin upon the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>The other reaſon, why the Holy Spirit hath divided the
<hi>Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iſado's</hi> into
two <hi>Plagues,</hi> and into two <hi>Vials,</hi> and why he hath not done the
like by the two <hi>Reformations;</hi> is becauſe the <hi>Vials,</hi> as I
have often ſaid, ſignify <hi>Periods</hi> of Time. Nor could he aſcribe a
<hi>Vial</hi> to each <hi>Reformation;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe each of them apart,
would have conſiſted of too few years to conſtitute a <hi>Period.</hi>
For as the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the <hi>laſt</hi> Age was wrought in 25.
or 30. years; ſo that which we do next ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, will in all probability be
brought to paſs in a leſs time. And therefore to have made two
<hi>Vials</hi> of them, he muſt have allowed each but 25. or 30. years
continuance. Which would carry no kind of proportion to the reſt of the
<hi>Vials,</hi> or to the for'going <hi>Periods,</hi> every one whereof were
much longer. Beſide, it would have been needful to have interpoſed a third
<hi>Vial,</hi> between the two <hi>Vials</hi> of the <hi>firſt</hi> and
<hi>ſecond Reformation,</hi> which ought to comprehend the time that
elapſeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the fore-going Age, and the
<hi>Reformation</hi> that we hope and wait for. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one will eaſily
perceive, that this would not have been a diſpoſing of the <hi>Vials</hi>
as they ought, and that it is much more natural, to make but one <hi>Vial,</hi>
or one <hi>Period</hi> of all the <hi>Times,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the
beginning, the progreſs, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of the deſtruction of the
<hi>Papacy,</hi> by means of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and of bringing the
Truth into light and evidence. This I take to be enough for the ſatisfying
perſons of juſtice and moderation in reference to the preſent difficulty.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94715:165"/>And we ought after all to conſider, that it is free for
the Spirit of God, to rank <hi>Events,</hi> and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them into
ſuch <hi>Claſses</hi> as he thinks meet. The whole which belongs to us in
this caſe, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Relation and Agreement of the
<hi>Events</hi> unto and with the Prophetical <hi>Schemes</hi> and
<hi>Images.</hi> Now it is evident, that the <hi>Figures</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
concerning the <hi>ſeven Plagues,</hi> do admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly accord with the
<hi>Events</hi> to which we have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed them. So that now I think we may
return to the Reaſons aſſigned by the <hi>Author</hi> of the
<hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrations upon the Apocalypſe,</hi> which he calls a kind of
Demonſtrations, proving that none of the <hi>Vials</hi> are yet poured
out.</p>
            <p>His third Reaſon, ſo far as I can comprehend it, is, that all
the ſeven <hi>Vials</hi> are contained under the <hi>third Wo,</hi>
pronounced by the Angel, when he cried, <hi>Wo, wo, wo to the Inhabitants of
the Earth, by reaſon of the other voices of the Trumpet of the three Angels
which are yet to ſound.</hi> For, ſaith that <hi>Author,</hi> the third
<hi>Wo</hi> ſhall not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed until after the ſounding of the
laſt <hi>Trumpet.</hi> And <hi>S. John</hi> ſaith, Chap. 11. v. 14. <hi>The
ſecond Wo is paſt, and behold the third Wo cometh quickly.</hi> To which he
adds, <hi>And the ſeventh An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ſounded, and there were great voices in
Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſaying, the Kingdoms of this world are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Kingdoms of our
Lord.</hi> If then the <hi>ſeven Vials</hi> be all contained under the
<hi>third Wo,</hi> and if the <hi>third Wo</hi> be not to come to paſs till
the ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet,</hi> and if this <hi>laſt</hi>
Trumpet, which is to bring over the Kingdoms of the World to Jeſus Chriſt,
have not hitherto ſounded, 'tis then, ſays he, evident, that none of the
<hi>Vials</hi> are yet poured out. And he concludes, <hi>that this doth
invincibly follow,</hi> &amp;c. Tho for <pb n="26" facs="tcp:94715:166"/>my part I do not
comprehend, how theſe can be ſtiled invincible proofs. Nor is it true, that
the third <hi>Wo</hi> is contained under the ſeventh <hi>Trumpet.</hi> But
'tis true, that this <hi>laſt</hi> Trumpet ſhall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and without
any interval follow the third <hi>Wo;</hi> ſo that we are not to wonder, that
the Holy Spirit ſpeaketh of theſe two things, as conjoined together. The
<hi>third Wo</hi> is the laſt Fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the moment of its
total ruin. The ſeventh <hi>Trumpet</hi> is the moment of Jeſus Chriſt's
entring upon his <hi>Kingdom.</hi> For we may truly reckon the beginning of the
Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt to commence immediately after the Fall of
<hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon;</hi> tho it will not attain to its perfection and glory, until
that the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. This proof, that is
propoſed unto us as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, is herein weak, that it ſuppoſeth a
thing which is not true, and which the <hi>Author</hi> cannot advance any
reaſon in confirmation of; Namely, <hi>that the Plagues and the ſeven Vials
are all comprehended in the third Wo.</hi> Whereas there is not ſo much as
one of them therein contained. For the third <hi>Wo</hi> is to arrive at the
End of the ſeventh <hi>Vial,</hi> and of the ſeventh <hi>Period</hi> of the
downfal of the <hi>Papacy.</hi> But when one ſuppoſeth what he pleaſeth,
he may alſo prove what he pleaſeth. Only he ought not to call
ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that are more than uncertain, <hi>invincible Reaſons.</hi>
And to prove that the ſeven <hi>Vials</hi> are not comprehended in the third
<hi>Wo;</hi> it is enough to prove, as we have done, that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>Vials</hi> are ſeven <hi>Periods</hi> of Time, which run along as water
runs out of an <hi>Hour glaſs.</hi> For ſeven <hi>Periods of time</hi>
cannot be comprehended within the Time of the third <hi>Wo,</hi> ſeeing that
<hi>Wo</hi> it ſelf is confined to the compaſs of a few 
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94715:166"/>years. The third <hi>Wo</hi> is properly that which the
Holy Spirit <hi>chap.</hi> 14. calls the <hi>Vintage.</hi> 'Tis added by the
Author, <hi>that the Vials muſt neceſſarily be ſtill to be poured out,
becauſe we are yet under the ſixth Trumpet.</hi> 'Tis true, that we are yet
under the <hi>ſixth</hi> Trumpet; but it is almoſt 800. years, that this
<hi>ſixth</hi> Trumpet hath been pouring forth its Influences. For as we have
ſaid, it is ſubdivided into ſeven <hi>Vials,</hi> and we are now towards
the end of the ſeventh <hi>Vial</hi> of the ſixth <hi>Trumpet.</hi> Nor are
we to think it ſtrange, that the ſixth <hi>Trumpet</hi> comprehends ſo
many Ages; ſeeing the ſeventh <hi>Seal</hi> contains a great deal more,
becauſe compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the <hi>Trumpets</hi> into which it is ſubdivided,
it reacheth from the Reign of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> until the End of the World.
And our affirming that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth <hi>Seal</hi> comprehends under it the
ſeven <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,</hi> is not a ſuppoſition advanced at random;
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> does plainly inform us of it. For he does
nothing at the opening of the ſeventh <hi>Seal,</hi> of that which he had
done at the opening of the former, but all he doth is to give the ſeven
<hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets</hi> to the ſeven <hi>Angels. And when he had opened the
ſeventh Seal, there was ſilence in Heaven about the ſpace of half an
hour, and I ſaw the ſeven An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels which ſtood before God, and to them
were given ſeven Trumpets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, that the Holy Spirit doth not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſay,
that the <hi>ſixth</hi> Trumpet is ſubdivided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>ſeven Vials.</hi>
But this may be gathered from the ſixth <hi>Trumpets</hi> ſounding at the
time of the <hi>Turk's</hi> invading the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire, which was
about the tenth Age, and from our finding that the firſt <hi>Vial</hi> fell
about the ſame ſeaſon on the Empire of the <hi>Beaſt:</hi> So that the
courſe of the <hi>Vials</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined within the ſixth
<hi>Trumpet,</hi> and before the 7th.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:94715:167"/>
            <p>The fourth Reaſon brought by the <hi>Author</hi> of the
<hi>Illuſtrations on the Apocalypſe,</hi> to prove that all the
<hi>Vials</hi> are yet to be poured out, is that the <hi>Vials</hi> are nothing
elſe ſave the ſeven <hi>Thunders</hi> ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Chap. 10. and that the
ſeven <hi>Thunders</hi> are adjourned till the ſound of the ſeventh
<hi>Trumpet.</hi> For <hi>St. John</hi> being about to write, it was ſaid to
him, <hi>Seal the things which the ſeven Thunders have uttered, and write
them not.</hi> I beg the <hi>Author's</hi> pardon, if I ſay that this
Reaſon is accompanied with two great faults. The <hi>firſt</hi> is, that it
ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a thing which is more than doubtful. The <hi>ſecond</hi> is,
that if it were true, yet the inference deduced from thence ſignifies
nothing. Firſt, he ſuppoſeth that the ſeven <hi>Thunders</hi> are one
and the ſame thing with the ſeven <hi>Vials.</hi> And I can hardly gueſs
upon what ground he is able to raiſe ſo ſtrang an opinion, and one that
is ſo little agreeable to his own principles. For as to the number
<hi>ſeven,</hi> that is found alike in the <hi>Thunders</hi> and in the
<hi>Vials;</hi> all men know that this can be no proof; other way's the ſeven
<hi>Spirits,</hi> the ſeven <hi>Lamps,</hi> and the ſeven
<hi>Trumpets,</hi> ſhould all be the ſame thing with the ſeven
<hi>Vials.</hi> Nor doth it agree with the principles of the <hi>Author.</hi>
For if the ſeven <hi>Thunders</hi> and the ſeven <hi>Vials</hi> are only to
take up the ſpace of 12. or 15. <hi>years,</hi> at the very end of
<hi>Antichriſts</hi> Reign; how then comes he to ſpeak of an affair that
ſhould poſſeſs ſo little a time of the whole duration of the
<hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Empire, before he had ſpoken of the riſe &amp;
growth of that <hi>Empire?</hi> why doth the H. Spirit ſpeak by S.
<hi>John</hi> of the 7. <hi>Thunders</hi> that are to exterminate an
<hi>Empire,</hi> when he had not before ſpoken one word of its birth and
grandure? So that what we have ſaid is much more probable, namely that the
ſeven <hi>Thunders</hi> are the <hi>Oracles</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed 
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94715:167"/>to the <hi>Prophet</hi> about all that concerns the
<hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Empire. Which Oracles are ſtiled <hi>Thunders,</hi>
becauſe of the doleful Events which they do foretel. <hi>Thunders</hi>
precede the breaking out of the lightning. And they are mentioned by the number
of <hi>ſeven,</hi> which is that of perfection, to ſignify thereby the
perfection of this Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I ſay, in the ſecond place, that if this ſuppoſition were
true, viz. that the ſeven <hi>Thunders</hi> are the ſame thing with the
ſeven <hi>Plagues;</hi> it doth no way follow from hence, that the ſeven
<hi>Thunders</hi> and the ſeven <hi>plagues</hi> are not to take place until
the time of the ſeventh <hi>Trumpet.</hi> Nor is this intended by theſe
words, <hi>Seal them up, and write them not.</hi> All that this can ſignify,
is only that the ſeven <hi>Thunders</hi> were not ſuddenly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed;
but it is not therefore needful, that they ſhould be delayed until after 16
or 17 hundred years. For ſeeing the ſeven <hi>Thunders</hi> or the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>plagues,</hi> begun ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
till the <hi>tenth</hi> Age, nine hundred years were enough to the
<hi>Prophet,</hi> to make him ſay that the <hi>Thunders</hi> were not
imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to manifeſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>Finally, that I may omit nothing which the <hi>Author</hi> upon
this ſubject may call a proof or a Reaſon, I think that I may reckon for
his fifth Argument, his ſaying, that <hi>the Vials shall be poured out within
a ſmall diſtance of time the one from the other, becauſe 'tis ſaid,
chap.</hi> 10. <hi>that the Angel ſware, that there should be time no
longer.</hi> Few can apprehend the ſtrength of this pretended proof. For
theſe words, <hi>there shall be time no longer,</hi> have not the leaſt
reference, ſo far as I can perceive, neither to the ſeven Thunders, nor to
the ſeven <hi>Vials.</hi> And it may be affirmed with the greateſt 
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94715:168"/>certainty, that theſe words, <hi>there shall be time no
longer,</hi> are to be joined with the following, <hi>but in the days of the
voice of the ſeventh Angel, when he shall begin to ſound, the Myſtery of
God shall be finished.</hi> The <hi>Author</hi> hath very well obſerved, that
<hi>the Myſtery of God,</hi> is the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt,
which we are in expectation of. So that this ſignifies, that when the
<hi>Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> shall come at the ſounding of the
ſeventh <hi>Trumpet,</hi> that then there shall be no longer either
<hi>Time,</hi> or <hi>Times,</hi> or <hi>a half of Time,</hi> for the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of God. But this neither refers to the <hi>plagues,</hi> nor to the
<hi>Vials,</hi> nor to the Thunders. This is what I have to ſay for
juſtifying my Expoſition of the 16. <hi>Chap.</hi> of the
<hi>Revelation,</hi> concerning the <hi>ſeven Vials</hi> and the <hi>ſeven
Plagues.</hi> And I hope that the <hi>Author</hi> of the
<hi>Illuſtrations</hi> will not take this ſhort <hi>Apology</hi> amiſs,
ſeeing it detracts nothing from the Eſteem which I have both for his
<hi>Perſon</hi> and for his <hi>Book.</hi>
